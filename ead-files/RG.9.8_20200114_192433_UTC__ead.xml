    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Institute of Afro-American Affairs at New York University was founded in 1969 to research, document, and celebrate the cultural and intellectual production of Africa and its diaspora in the Atlantic world and beyond. The Institute is affiliated and shares leadership, staff, and facilities with NYU's Africana Studies Program. Both organizations are committed to the study of Blacks in modernity through concentrations in Pan-Africanism and Black Urban Studies. Now called the Institute of African American Affairs, the Institute each year brings to NYU Artists and Scholars-in-Residence, who during their residencies participate in seminars, offer public presentations of their work, and meet with students. Past Artists-in-Residence have included author Walter Mosley; poet and essayist Amiri Baraka; actor, playwright, and performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; poet Jayne Cortez; actor and producer Danny Glover; and Malian musician Salif Keita. Scholars-in-Residence have included Nigerian author and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka; and David Levering Lewis, MacArthur Fellow and Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of History at Rutgers.</p><p>Sources: </p><p><list><item>Afro-American Affairs, Institute of, Archives H, NYU Archives.</item></list> </p>  </bioghist>

Repeat guests included Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Basil Paterson; President of the New York Urban Coalition Arthur Barnes; Editor for <emph render="italic">Black Sports Magazine</emph> Allan Barron; Editor-at-Large for <emph render="italic">Black Enterprise</emph> magazine Pat Patterson; jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams; authors Nathan Huggins and John O.

The host of the program, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. was also the Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs (IAAA) at NYU at the time. The show's mission was to be "a showcase for Black scholarship….to examine the foundations of African-American thought from a variety of areas," according to founding documents for the show. During each episode, Brown conducted an informal, back and forth dialogue with a variety of professionals, mainly from the New York City area, who spoke personally to the unique challenges of the Black experience. These shows initially aired at 10pm and 12am on WNBC and were rebroadcast a few weeks later on WNYU.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_ref3848" level="file"><did><unittitle>Moses, Gil -- Director of the Broadway play <emph render="italic">Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death</emph>.</unittitle><unitid>RG9.8-86</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="178016" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">178016</unitid><unitdate normal="1971/1971" type="inclusive">1971 October 26</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_a100f70d08bfcc55f3db9f9d28be6568" label="Physical Facet note">Format: Reel
