    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The New York City Immigrant Labor History Project was led by Herbert Gutman, a professor of history at the City College of New York (CCNY), between 1972 and 1976.  The project sought to reexamine immigrants' and migrants' patterns of cultural adaptation to urban and industrial life in the early 20th century in order to challenge the prevailing theories in social history at the time.  Gutman designed the project to combine traditional historical research methods with the relatively new approach of oral history.  By documenting the lives of immigrants and migrants who settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930 and compiling data on their family relationships, work patterns, and associational lives, Gutman hoped to reveal the ways in which people from rural, non-industrial areas adapted to the structured environment of the factory and the crowded city.  </p><p>Between 1973 and 1975 almost 230 oral history interviews were conducted with Eastern Europeans, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants; black and Puerto Rican migrants; and the children of immigrants and migrants.  The interviews were conducted by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in CCNY's Department of History.  Gutman oversaw the entire project and taught courses designed to prepare the student interviewers for conducting the oral histories.  Virginia Yans-McLaughlin, then assistant professor of history at CCNY, co-managed the project with Gutman and directed undergraduate student interviewers.  Three junior faculty members, Leon Fink, William Eric Perkins, and Ari Joel Perlmann, conducted interviews and taught courses related to the project.  Ronald Grele, an oral historian, served as a consultant and provided direction on the oral history interviews and conducted training sessions for the interviewers.   </p><p>The project staff worked closely with labor unions, cultural organizations, and nursing homes in New York City, including the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814; the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home; Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union; the National Council of Jewish Women; and the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged.  These organizations facilitated meetings between project staff and interested members or residents and allowed the project staff to arrange and conduct interviews.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The New York City Immigrant Labor History Project Oral History Collection consists of 222 interviews with Eastern European, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants and black and Puerto Rican migrants, most of whom settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930.  Topics include education, childhood, and early life in the narrators' countries and states of origin; arrival at Ellis Island and first impressions of New York City; assimilation; women's roles in the workforce and in the household; courtship, marriage, and  family life; processes of acquiring and retaining work; job responsibilities, wages, and working conditions; ethnic and racial makeup of different workforces, factories, and shops; labor unions and organizing in different industries; ethnic and inter-racial relations in the community and the workplace; living conditions in New York City neighborhoods; politics; leisure activities; and religion.  </p><p>The interviews capture the narrators' pre-industrial experiences as a way of exploring their adaptation to life in an urban, industrial environment by covering all aspects of their life experiences.  They record the narrators' memories from their childhoods through to the time of the interviews.  The majority of the narrators were in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, with at least two narrators being over 100 years old.  The interviews contain recollections of the narrators' countries and states of origin; their reasons for emigrating or migrating; their working and family lives in New York City and elsewhere in the United States (US); their union and political activity; and religious, ethnic, or social organizations to which they may have belonged. </p><p>The narrators include first and second generation immigrants and migrants; men and women; Jews and Christians; and anarchists, Communists, Democrats, Socialists, and Republicans.  Occupations represented in this collection include garment workers, fur workers, longshoremen, musicians, household employees, cooks, carpenters, dancers, union organizers, electricians, elevator operators, and taxi drivers.  Labor unions represented in this collection include the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America; Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees International Union; International Fur and Leather Workers Union; International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; International Longshoremen's Association; International Union of Operating Engineers; Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union; New York City Taxi Drivers Union Local 3036; United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America; United Furniture Workers of America; and United Hatters of North America.  Cultural, ethnic, and social organizations discussed include the Carroll Park Senior Citizens Center; Congress of Italian Americans Organization; Council Workshop for Senior Citizens sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women; Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center; and the Workmen's Circle.</p><p>The interviews include women who never worked outside the home, both married and unmarried; women who left the workforce permanently after marriage and childbirth; women who returned to the workforce after the birth of each of their children; and others who returned only after all of their children had entered primary school or entered the workforce themselves.  Some narrators settled first in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, and Illinois before moving to New York.  Others immigrated to other European countries or Cuba before immigrating to the US.  Some returned a number of times to their countries of origin before settling permanently in the US.  There are interviews with people who became heavily involved in the labor movement while others did not concern themselves with union activity.  </p><p>The collection includes 11 compilations of excerpts from interviews, based on a specific topic, such as ethnicity, politics, and neighborhoods.  There are also recordings of roundtable discussions with potential narrators at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Local 22.</p><p>Transcripts, indices, interview fact sheets, subject cards, and summaries are available for many of the interviews and are noted in the container summary when available.  An electronic version of all transcripts, indices, interview fact sheets, subject cards, and summaries are available by request.  Many of the transcripts do not contain the full interview.  The indices contain subject terms or phrases with the corresponding time on the recording at which they are discussed.  Some of the summaries contain a brief description of what is discussed at a certain time in the recording; others contain synopses of interview highlights without the corresponding time notes.  The interview fact sheets contain information relevant to the interests of Gutman and the project staff and were filled out by the narrators; a small amount of these were received with the donation.  The subject cards contain the same sort of information as the indices and summaries, but are typed on index cards and separated into subjects such as family, work, and education before and after immigration.</p>  </scopecontent>

This interview covers Sedrkk Accent's life in Saint Kitts; his work as a boxer and later, a coal trimmer and fireman aboard ships; and his eventual immigration to the United States in 1963.  Accent begins by recounting his career as a boxer and how he enjoyed it.  He notes that while his first wife was very supportive of his career, often sitting in the front row during many of his matches, his second wife held little love for the sport and his involvement with it.  He describes the infidelity of his first wife; the tempestuous nature of their relationship; his discovery of her affair with a local police officer; and the violent dissolution of their marriage.  Accent describes his career as both a trimmer and a fireman aboard ships that sailed to a variety of locations including England, Italy, Greece, Canada, the Netherlands, Argentina, and Santo Domingo.  He recounts switching from trimmer to fireman because the latter was a less labor intensive job.  Despite admitting that he was not the most diligent Seventh-Day Adventist, he spends a good portion of the interview explaining the philosophy of his religion including his view of God as merciful and wonderful; the concept of doing the right thing to each and every human being; the need to lend a helping hand wherever it was needed; and the importance of upholding the Sabbath.</p><p>See also: Council Workshop for Senior Citizens I.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Saint Kitts and Nevis.</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Seventh-Day Adventist men -- Religious life.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref850" level="file"><did><unittitle>Altman, Yetta</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593191" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593191</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_d6c594e31cd0244574fe615289dd7629" label="master reel [31142054875268]" type="box">86</container><container id="aspace_73c1cbc57ad35477c55b90a508260ff2" parent="aspace_d6c594e31cd0244574fe615289dd7629" type="reel">850a - 850b</container><container id="aspace_8bcadbfd3cb3ff0a28b16512285d46da" label="master reel [31142054875276]" type="box">87</container><container id="aspace_1bc60871181319acbc43c388f480b930" parent="aspace_8bcadbfd3cb3ff0a28b16512285d46da" type="reel">850c</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_0eefb84819adc3241e29228bafb256d4" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_2db88cd37cd6114359029d84753c6bb3" parent="aspace_0eefb84819adc3241e29228bafb256d4" type="Folder">2</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/0rxwdjwj" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Altman, Yetta: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Altman, Yetta: Audio Recording: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_9901ae058aed6f4d9e1ce04f576c571d"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Yetta Altman was born in Poland around 1905.

She was one of five children.  After immigrating, the family initially stayed with Artler's uncle before moving to Brooklyn, New York, where her father opened a butcher shop.  Artler attended school until she was fourteen, moving into the labor force as soon as she was able.  She worked predominantly in the garment district, making both children's and ladies' dresses, until shortly after her marriage.  Work was seasonally based, so Artler spent part of the year unemployed, varying from a month to half of the year.  While working in the factories, she became a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and participated in both social and union activities.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_3fdf0bdc8eddf9420c48b13eccad20b8"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This interview was conducted on March 7, 1975 by Louise Mayo at an unknown location.  This interview covers Bea (Gitlin) Artler's childhood in Poland; her immigration to the United States as a young child; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her father's occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her initial years in New York City living in the back of her father's butcher shop.  As business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better rent or living arrangements.  She briefly describes her three years of school, placing more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat ornaments, children's dresses, and the fronts of ladies' dresses.  She describes the conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither exceptionally dirty or crowded.  She mentions the worker demographic as being split between Italians and Jews and that the two groups got along well within the workspace.  She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle.  Artler notes that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment the household's income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the money she earned.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and her participation in strikes for higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union eventually succeeded in acquiring.  She recounts participating in union sponsored social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union.

The date and location are unknown.  This interview covers Morris Bagno's childhood in Poland; his immigration to various European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York and California.  Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting that the industry in his town was much smaller than in the cities that he would encounter in the US.  He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry.  He describes his decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to escape his father's orthodox Judaism.  He recalls his immigration to various countries in which he lived including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada before his immigration to the US in 1920.  He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he grew up.  He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a job on his own and his his uncle's belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon him.  He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership.  He discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison between workers and employers.  He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs or interfering in his affairs.  He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization.  He recalls temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref14" level="file"><did><unittitle>Belson, Abraham</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344023" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344023</unitid><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 February 26 and March 12 </unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_f013aff46957f32cda52d357bb5834b1" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_441e3f6afaa0d4e3379579a89dff5744" parent="aspace_f013aff46957f32cda52d357bb5834b1" type="cd">ref14, ref14a-d</container><container id="aspace_ab40dab4bf3521cab5ba3193f415b6e4" label="master reel [31142054874444]" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_4283a77625df138997cc1d1397d1e22f" parent="aspace_ab40dab4bf3521cab5ba3193f415b6e4" type="reel">14a - 14b</container><container id="aspace_c83e4b3968d1baf33596a628ef642123" label="master reel [31142054874451]" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_d89d65871a5ea29fc767fc276d5788ac" parent="aspace_c83e4b3968d1baf33596a628ef642123" type="reel">14c - 14f</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/kd51cchv" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Belson, Abraham" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Belson, Abraham: 1975 February 26 and March 12</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_8d1c7d6b3d952b948678c83089c79328"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Abraham Belson was born in a small town near Minsk, Russia.

The location is unknown.  This interview covers Abraham Belson's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in Massachusetts and New York.  Belson begins by describing part of his father's history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father's refusal and subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years.  Belson recounts his membership in an unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an authority that was not concerned with his well-being.  He describes immigrating to the US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and many friends from his hometown lived.  He spends the rest of the interview focused on the happenings of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he joined in 1907.  He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks, resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to compromise.  He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied for its first large general strike in 1910.  Belson describes the camaraderie that he felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the picnics and other outings they had during their free time.  He notes that this was common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members.  He recalls becoming a union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every year.  Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines in order to work.  He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union liaison.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Antisemitism |z Russia |x History |y 20th century.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref15" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bialon, Stella</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344024" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344024</unitid><unitdate normal="1975/1975">1975</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_8c842c319abb471075a7cd38be66f3e5" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_4bf6b10270b565612c7b579aab8b2081" parent="aspace_8c842c319abb471075a7cd38be66f3e5" type="Folder">92</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_03bfe68137052fe5f261dc387e981ef7"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Stella Bialon was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1895.

This interview covers Ethel Bolton's childhood in England; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1901; and her life and work in New Jersey and New York.  Topics regarding Bolton's childhood in England include her mother's death when Bolton was five years old; the subsequent immigration of her father and older siblings to the US while she remained in England with her grandfather; and her father's second marriage in the US.  Bolton describes her father's work as a printer, noting that he held various jobs at newspaper companies from the <emph render="italic">Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper</emph> in London, England to the <emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Wall Street Journal</emph> in New York.  She explains that he was an active member of Typographical #6 of the International Typographical Union and was involved in various strikes which resulted in food rationing for his family.  Bolton describes her dislike for her stepmother, recalling that she often faked illness so that Bolton was required to stay home from school to care for her and attributes the various relocations between New York and New Jersey to her stepmother's antagonism towards neighbors and local ministers.  </p><p>Bolton explains that she married Joe Bolton in 1922 after an extended courtship due to her desire to remain single and avoid the misery she saw her married friends enduring.  She recounts adopting his teenage children as her own.  She discusses the fact that her husband tended to treat her as if she were a child due to the age gap between them and that she made a point of following his rules except in voting.  She briefly recounts working as a caretaker for young children before working as a switchboard operator at two advertising agencies, the Geland Sumner Company and the Kudner Agency.  At Kudner, she describes her work in the checking department, reviewing advertisements from Nebraska to Texas.

Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York.  This interview covers Ernestine Brown's childhood in St. George, South Carolina; her migration to New York, New York; and her life and work as family nurse in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Brown discusses her childhood on a large plantation in St. George, where she helped grow and harvest peas, corn, cotton, and tobacco.  She notes that the plantation, granted to the family by the federal government due to her grandmother's Cherokee heritage, spread for miles and isolated them from the surrounding communities.  She explains that in order to keep the plantation self-sufficient, many of her family members assumed various roles within the community, with one of her cousins working as the schoolteacher and her great uncle and father working as preachers in the local church.  She discusses her grandmother's role as the matriarch of the family.  She recounts her move to Charleston, South Carolina, mentioning that she had never interacted with a white person before arriving in the city.  She focuses on the stifled interactions between the racial groups in the city, describing the influence of the Jim Crow laws; and the intense scrutiny that black residents faced from white police officers.  She describes the differences between the schools in St. George and in Charleston.    </p><p>Brown describes her move to New York City, where she was reunited with her husband.  She discusses her initial impressions of New York City, conveying the security she felt in living there through anecdotes about sleeping on the roof and fire escapes, and keeping her door open at night.  Brown recalls how her husband found work through a Civilian Conservation Corps camp, which resulted in his Army service during World War II. She explains that she was wary of her husband when he came back from the Army, having heard stories of other veterans' changed demeanor and behavior.  Brown emphasizes the changes in Harlem as a strong black community developed in the wake of white flight.  She spends a considerable amount of time noting the differences among the churches in St. George, Charleston, and Harlem, noting that St. George's preachers focused more on serving the community and the preachers in Charleston and Harlem focused on more secular matters.  Brown later describes her husband's brief, but serious illness, which resulted in multiple hospital visits before he died at home by her side.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref22" level="file"><did><unittitle>Buono, Antonio</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344031" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344031</unitid><unitdate>1975 April 11</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_ed5d134c1cece181cf9b694ff185ec8f" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_7906dd36d67caade07b91f48c40a2daf" parent="aspace_ed5d134c1cece181cf9b694ff185ec8f" type="cd">ref22</container><container id="aspace_28e2dd5723ff3fc483767889381883fd" label="master reel [31142054874477]" type="box">7</container><container id="aspace_77690e7224e8db721dbfa2d441ae69bb" parent="aspace_28e2dd5723ff3fc483767889381883fd" type="reel">22a - 22b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/2fqz675p" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Buono, Antonio" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Buono, Antonio: 1975 April 11</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_0cca6ee52fe0349899cc5bdd57aaf783"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Antonio Buono was born in 1915 in the town of Ischia, Italy.

Antonio Buono and an unidentified friend frequently converse in Italian during the interview.  This interview covers Buono's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1934; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Buono begins by describing his childhood on a small farm in Italy, recalling his father's immigration to the US in 1902 and his sporadic visits to Italy.  He recounts his and his twin brother's decision to immigrate to the US and join their father in Brooklyn, where Buono worked in a small provisions factory.  He recounts his decision to work as a longshoreman because of the flexibility of the work hours and the increase in pay.  He recalls that though the job was labor intensive, the fresh air, consistent hours, and waterfront view made the job much more bearable than factory work.  He describes how joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association) in 1940 helped to maintain his wages and hours and explains that there were few strikes during World War II in order to maintain the war effort.  Buono describes the relationship among the Italians in Brooklyn, many of whom were longshoremen, and notes that although the immigrants from different parts of Italy could be clannish when they socialized, they would present a united front in the workplace.  Other topics include his leisure activities and Italian traditions that were kept alive in the United States.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref24" level="file"><did><unittitle>Burke, William</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344033" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344033</unitid><unitdate normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974 March 26 and April 2</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_37b5afdbdad9cf56203dcd0fb78fba1e" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_30a935f731dcf37ee48b3ca0cfa0f7bf" parent="aspace_37b5afdbdad9cf56203dcd0fb78fba1e" type="cd">ref24, ref24a-d</container><container id="aspace_de0726dcc610439fed75232ef135d821" label="master reel [31142054874485]" type="box">8</container><container id="aspace_189286069c703f73ff5dc70fea4c4acb" parent="aspace_de0726dcc610439fed75232ef135d821" type="reel">24</container><container id="aspace_8b9a32bdd447fae0293908843d4e98fb" label="master reel [31142054874493]" type="box">9</container><container id="aspace_c19ac3e7698094ba6693d9d2b81754ff" parent="aspace_8b9a32bdd447fae0293908843d4e98fb" type="reel">24</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/xpnvx6s5" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Burke, William" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Burke, William: 1974 March 26 and April 2</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_4506928d9dcd4124a500178712eb8683"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>William Burke was born in 1905 into a large family in Abbeyknockmoy, County Galway, Ireland.

He also discusses the differences between New York City in the 1920s and at the time of the interview, including money going farther and people acting respectfully.  He explains that he joined the ILA because he could not work without being in the union, and that union benefits did not start until after World War II.  He discusses working on long term projects out of state; and that longshoremen did not want their children to become longshoremen unless they were not good students.</p><p>See also: Cinisomo, Mario; Ferentino, Rosario and Mario Cinisomo; and Passage.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref856" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cappoletti, Caroline Lavecchia</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593197" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593197</unitid><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 April 28</unitdate><container id="aspace_975a6c05bb1854a688e2c5153fd813eb" label="master reel [31142054875284]" type="box">88</container><container id="aspace_2b837206d474ecdd9848dc6b90b04822" parent="aspace_975a6c05bb1854a688e2c5153fd813eb" type="reel">856a</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_edf6efced7c348367ac50a45ee0072c1" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_6b61297b4ac5f264acba1c1d0420c94c" parent="aspace_edf6efced7c348367ac50a45ee0072c1" type="Folder">8</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/mgqnkhj8" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Cappoletti, Caroline Lavecchia: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Cappoletti, Caroline Lavecchia: Audio Recording: 1973 April 28</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_4a12228b5341c9b8d5acb6d43d2e05a7"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Caroline Lavecchia Cappeletti was born in 1908 in a small town in Sicily, Italy.

This interview covers Elizabeth Clanton's childhood in Alabama; her migration throughout the United States (US); her work as a nurses' aide; and her union activity.  She begins by describing her childhood in Atmore, Alabama.  She focuses on how Atmore was divided along racial lines, describing segregation in neighborhoods, schools, churches, and the movies; and the limited, strained social contact between members of the white and black communities.  She also describes learning how to read in school, which enabled her to read the newspaper for her parents, neither of whom were literate.  Other topics from her childhood include her close relationship with her father; some of her grandparents' history; leisure activities; holiday traditions; the type of music to which she listened; and her religious traditions and values.  </p><p>Clanton explains that it was typical for parents to decide who was an appropriate match for their daughters and describes the strict rules that governed interactions between young men and women.  She describes meeting and marrying her first husband in Alabama despite her family's reservations about her being too young and her occupation as a domestic worker for various families in Atmore, a position that she acquired from her mother when the latter became ill.  She spends a great deal of time discussing her movement throughout the US, including moving to Cleveland, Ohio in order to find domestic work to support her children, whom she had left with her parents after she separated from her husband; receiving a certificate in practical nursing in Chicago, Illinois; and moving to Brooklyn, New York to live with one of her sons.  She recalls sending much of the money she earned back to her family and writing letters to her mother and children to accompany each paycheck. 
 
Clanton discusses her union involvement, including being introduced to the idea of unions by organizer Jesse Olson while working at Beth Israel Hospital, as a nurses' aide, in Manhattan; going to various hotels in New York City for union meetings; discussing union activities with co-workers only on breaks or after work; and participating in a hospital workers' strike in 1959.  Clanton discusses her opinion that despite the union not supporting striking workers sufficiently she realized the benefits of belonging to a union; her appreciation of Local 1199 after her retirement; and the educational programs and social activities that Local 1199 provided.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">African Americans -- Relations with Jews.</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Cleveland (Ohio) |x Economic conditions |y 20th century.</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref791" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cohen, Arthur</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593137" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593137</unitid><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 April 27</unitdate><container id="aspace_7029362613cc901ee24bd5063824f68b" label="master reel [31142054875193]" type="box">79</container><container id="aspace_02b3ae1489b98bfd3d64ccbe7ee5c2eb" parent="aspace_7029362613cc901ee24bd5063824f68b" type="reel">791a</container><container id="aspace_031bb212221b5e6968674e7b14e976eb" label="master reel [31142054875201]" type="box">80</container><container id="aspace_4196d915d2af657f057738eb84be4d0f" parent="aspace_031bb212221b5e6968674e7b14e976eb" type="reel">791b</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_0bd364ce76607cb7c38504fda9ffcb44" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_768570ca6c8347365fa06188ffa3a9da" parent="aspace_0bd364ce76607cb7c38504fda9ffcb44" type="Folder">12</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/t76hdzg7" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Cohen, Arthur: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Cohen, Arthur: Audio Recording: 1973 April 27</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_8bd44841a3f281c79f2ec7faaf86a6c1"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Arthur Cohen was born in New York, New York around 1886 and was the youngest of seven sons.

The date is unknown, and the location is likely the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814 Union Hall in Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Vincent DeMatteis' family and his working life.  DeMatteis discusses his father, including his work as a real estate agent in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a longshoreman.  DeMatteis describes his own apprenticeship to a jeweler, including some of the training he received.  He discusses his decision to become a longshoreman, against his father's wishes, as he was unable to find work as a jeweler during the Great Depression.  He describes different jobs longshoremen performed, including unloading, checking, and sorting goods from ships.  He discusses differences on the waterfront between the 1930s and the time of the interview, many of them being the result of the the creation of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor in 1953 and the success of the International Longshoremen's Association in the 1960s in organizing the workers.  He discusses the structure of the work day; the way in which jobs were distributed; the way men obtained jobs as longshoremen; and the way ships were unloaded.  He discusses the ways in which longshoremen kept busy on days when there was no work; DeMatteis' household chores on those days; and the ethnic demographics of the piers in New York, most of which were controlled by Italians.  He discusses attempts at unionization on the waterfront; workers who wished for stronger unions being labeled communists; and the success of the ILA in the 1960s.</p><p>Subject cards are available for this interview.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref46" level="file"><did><unittitle>DePalo, Vincent</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344055" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344055</unitid><unitdate>1974 May 7</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_0a9f70d578042abc2f5bdc99618aba6c" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_4652758dc39ee5acf0805e21cf67b5ea" parent="aspace_0a9f70d578042abc2f5bdc99618aba6c" type="cd">ref46</container><container id="aspace_293630f09f31dc14be92588fef1a2964" label="master reel [31142054874550]" type="box">15</container><container id="aspace_0358f9bc046df151974f35611ce58767" parent="aspace_293630f09f31dc14be92588fef1a2964" type="reel">46a - 46b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/n8pk0w8x" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="DePalo, Vincent" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>DePalo, Vincent: 1974 May 7</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_731db32e99791d50eac58b5cbf2a612e"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Vincent DePalo was born near Bari, Italy in 1900.

The location and interviewer are unknown.  An unidentified man interjects comments throughout John Duffy's interview.  This interview covers Duffy's childhood in Ireland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1929; and his life and work in the retail and transportation industries in New York, New York.  Duffy begins by describing his hometown of Dundalk, Ireland, emphasizing the town's position as a thriving railroad junction and its various industries including shoe and tobacco manufacturing (specifically P.J. Carroll &amp; Company Limited).  He recalls the railroad being the major source of commerce and both his father and his grandfather working on the railroad.  He describes patterns of Irish immigration to the US, noting that many of the immigrants came from the western and southern towns in Ireland; that the Irish did not often immigrate as a family unit; the effects of religious and political conflicts on immigration; and the often contentious relationship between the Irish people and the English authorities.</p><p>Duffy describes immigrating to the US in June 1929 via the SS Leviathan, noting that he was able to bypass Ellis Island, New York due to his immigration paperwork being processed by the consulate in Dublin.  He explains that he immigrated because he had a desire to travel and he recounts living with an uncle before moving to a boarding house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  He focuses on his work in the supply department at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, emphasizing the mistreatment of workers in other departments in the store; the lack of job security; and the lack of stable promotion tracks for workers.  He explains that all of these factors contributed to the union organization of retail workers in the store, specifically through Local 65 of an unspecified retail workers' union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union).  He emphasizes the fragility of the early years of the union, describing tension among members when Bloomingdale's gave the workers a raise and had the union disperse the raises from a lump sum.  </p><p>Duffy recalls leaving Bloomingdale's in 1943 and becoming a transportation worker and joining the Transport Workers Union of America.  He emphasizes the union's slow organizational growth over the course of the 1940s and 1950s; the conflict between Communist and non-Communist factions in the union; and the way in which the union's president, Michael Quill, dealt with the Communists' attempts to gain power.  Other topics include religious, ethnic, and racial divisions in the workforce, particularly in the retail industry, and the negative relationship between Duffy's parish church and the Communist Party of the United States of America.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Transport workers |x Labor unions |z New York (State) |z New York |x History.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref331" level="file"><did><unittitle>Edwards, James</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344640" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344640</unitid><unitdate> 1974 March 27</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_dab58d65360759e71859c76c1ec447fc" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_ce0305b8ba2da4725ee578e3dc0d1400" parent="aspace_dab58d65360759e71859c76c1ec447fc" type="cd">ref331</container><container id="aspace_faa0d284ae662f753c59c7985b23afdf" label="master reel [31142054875144]" type="box">74</container><container id="aspace_086b7a28c10be9395c0723ed7f5761aa" parent="aspace_faa0d284ae662f753c59c7985b23afdf" type="reel">331a - 331b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/4mw6mh42" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Edwards, James" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Edwards, James:  1974 March 27</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_9eaf058510dadfc67059c1ac24d8dbaf"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>James Edwards was born in the early 1900s in North Carolina.

Topics of discussion include the availability and types of work for longshoremen; the hiring process and wages; and accidents on the waterfront.  Mario Cinisomo and Rosario Ferrentino discuss the different types of work done by longshoremen; the fact that each job had different levels of danger; that some jobs were dependent on the weather; and that all jobs were supervised differently by the foremen.  They recall that in the early 1920s, workers usually worked one or two days a week, increasing to three or four days a week before the Great Depression; that during the Great Depression employment opportunities were limited; that work was steady after the Great Depression; and, at the time of the interview, there was more stability in the field because of rules implemented by the ILA.  Cinisomo recalls standing on the corner of Columbia Street and President Street at five in the morning in an attempt to be hired each day, and going to each dock if he was not hired on the corner.  He explains that some workers were hired as a group rather than individually.  Ferrentino discusses occasionally working a full day but only getting paid for half and making 36 cents an hour.  Cinisomo and Ferrentino discuss workplace accidents, including winches falling out of gear and boxes falling on workers.  They discuss their belief that accidents were unavoidable in the industry and the fact that there was little or no injury compensation. </p><p>Subject cards are available for this interview.</p><p>See also: Canossa, Bruno; Cinisomo, Mario.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Depressions |y 1929 |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref344" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fields, [Unknown]</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="592018" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">592018</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/3n5tb8ww" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Fields, [Unknown]" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Fields, [Unknown]: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_f5b314311b38bb982ab8dc2e31f3d4d4"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mr. Fields was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands in the early 1900s and grew up in Vienna, Austria-Hungary.

He was one of eight children, with four brothers and three sisters.  His father made and sold glass windows.  Fox attended school in Russia for two years before apprenticing to a tailor.  He immigrated to the United States in 1906 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan, New York before moving to the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1916.  He married when he was around 20 years old and had three children.  He worked as a tailor in various shops in New York City and was an active member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Local 23.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_a759d38aeb0ee946971303444e875828"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This interview was conducted by Mark Hirsch on July 3, 1973 at Abe Fox's home.  Fox's accent, his tendency to mumble, and the fluctuation of volume over the course of the interview make him hard to understand.  The interview covers Fox's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and his work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Fox begins the interview by describing his childhood in Russia, focusing on anti-Semitism in his hometown, which included pogroms and abuse by the police.  He recounts not being paid during the three years of his tailoring apprenticeship and receiving meager pay for his long hours of work after his apprenticeship.  He recounts the Socialist Revolutionary Party meeting at his house and learning more about Socialism at the library until his library card was destroyed when it was learned that he was Jewish.  </p><p>Fox explains that he immigrated to the US in 1906 after several failed attempts to illegally cross the border into Austria in order to sail from a port in Poland.  He discusses living with his aunt's family on the East Side of Manhattan, recalling his acclimation to the spring weather and the low cost of food in New York City.  He describes his first job in a garment shop in New York City and explains that, in the beginning, he had to bring his own machine to work.  He notes that although he joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 23 in order to fight for better wages, hours, and working conditions, change was slow due to factions within the union and corruption among the union leaders.  He recalls a strike that occurred in the early 1950s, through which workers acquired a twenty percent wage increase despite conflicts with strikebreakers brought in from Chicago, Illinois.

There are summaries for three interviews with Ivory Gray conducted by Harris at Local 1199 on October 24, October 31, and November 7, 1975.  The interview on the recording covers Gray's initial impressions of New York, New York; his perception of the white community; and his working life in New York.</p><p>Gray explains that reading about Central Park and Cab Calloway in newspapers and experiencing the power imbalance in the sharecropping system prompted him to move to New York, New York.  He recalls warnings about the differences between people in New York and in the south, and tales of pickpockets upon his arrival in the city.  He recounts the various jobs he held before working in Montefiore Hospital, including dock worker; peddler; building superintendent and porter; and handyman.  He discusses the impact that religion had on both his and his father's lives; his father's conversion to Christianity and job as a deacon; and the church's role in disseminating and giving credence to the ideas that it was natural for black community members to feel inferior as minorities and that it was impossible to live Christian life in the northern United States (US).  He recalls that living outside of the southern US gave him a broader perspective concerning racial relations, prompting him to adopt the belief that all people are equal.</p><p>Gray discusses the change in his opinions of the white population after he started working at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York; the fact that working with a large group of people brought him into contact with different groups of people with whom he had never worked before; and his work as a delegate for Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union.  He recounts not encountering much racial discrimination in the northern US but attributes this to the fact that he was poor and did not have occasion to go to places that were likely to be segregated.  He explains that he would generally stay in areas with a majority black population and not put himself in a position in which he was likely to face discrimination and prejudice, although he does recount two incidents of discrimination he faced in New York.  He discusses jobs he had as a building superintendent in Manhattan, including his responsibilities; the types of people for whom he worked; and issues he had at the buildings regarding an unspecified building workers union.  He explains his decision to leave his work as a superintendent because of an illness and his desire to have a job with regular hours, which he found at Montefiore Hospital.  </p><p>Gray recounts one job he had as a porter at a coffee dehydrating business in the 1940s in which there was no discrimination and his boss and the other employees made a concerted effort to treat everyone equally, regardless of race.  He discusses the fact that he was encouraged to gain experience by shadowing repairmen who came to fix things in the building and regrets his decision to leave this job.</p><p>Summary is available for this interview.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Janitors |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race discrimination |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref77" level="file"><did><unittitle>Green, Rufus</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344085" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344085</unitid><unitdate normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974 May 4</unitdate><container id="aspace_b186c318e9e84e4513f327e266d770fa" label="master reel [31142054874618]" type="box">21</container><container id="aspace_1916ce8cd7c8ec44aaba54f687d5ad71" parent="aspace_b186c318e9e84e4513f327e266d770fa" type="reel">77a - 77b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/37pvmkx7" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Green, Rufus" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Green, Rufus: 1974 May 4</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_facfdea221edc052d7aea69cd8f29b87"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Rufus Green was born in Emmanuel College, Georgia in 1896.

The date and location of this interview are unknown.  This interview covers Fanny Heltzer's childhood in Russia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and her work in the garment industry and as a private nurse in New York, New York.  Heltzer begins the interview by describing her childhood in Kiev, noting that conversations regarding politics were forbidden in school; that she acquired her Socialist viewpoints from family and friends; and that she attended secret Socialist meetings.  She recalls that her mother paid for her to be a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev because her sister noted the high-paying opportunities in that industry in the US.  She describes her mother sending Heltzer's oldest sister to the US in the hopes that she would eventually be able to send for the rest of the family.  She explains that her brother was sent to Siberia due to his revolutionary activity and that their mother sent him to the United States in order to prevent his being arrested again.  She notes that she immigrated soon after him in 1906, with their two remaining sisters following her.  </p><p>Heltzer explains that she initially lived with her sister on Houston Street in Manhattan but moved in with a friend because of her sister's overbearing rules.  She explains that she acquired her first job in a ladies' shirtwaist shop through the recommendation of a friend, noting her initial fear of the speed and noise of the electric sewing machines; that the conditions of the shop were filthy; and that she quit because of the poor conditions and the long work week.  She explains that her next jobs in Manhattan, in a dress shop and at the Nemo Corset Company, were better due to the cleaner conditions in the shops.  She notes that employees at the Nemo Corset Company were afraid to organize and join a union because of the potentially hostile reaction from management.  She emphasizes the development of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union during her time in various garment shops, noting the union's cocern over working conditions and lack of job security.  </p><p>Heltzer recalls joining a dramatic club where she met her husband, emphasizing her and her husband's involvement with plays and the club's choral group.  She recalls that her husband worked as a watchmaker but also had other business ventures.  Heltzer describes moving to Shelton, Connecticut during World War I and later to Worcester, Massachusetts as her husband changed jobs.  She explains that he invested in cotton goods and lost nearly all of this money in a failed business venture in Worcester, prompting the family to move back to New York City.  She describes working as a machine operator for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through which she joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and the Workers' Unemployed Union (WUU), established in New York City by the Socialist Party of America.  She recalls moving through various neighborhoods in New York City in order to find better employment and living conditions, focusing on her time working in her husband's jewelry store on 41st Street and 10th Avenue.  She explains that a robbery in the store affected her husband's physical and mental health, prompting her to work at the store by herself for two years before closing it.  She emphasizes her family's involvement in and bonding through the Socialist Party, noting that her children grew up around party events due to her and her husband's labor union and other party activities.  </p><p>Other topics include a nursing course Heltzer took at Beth Israel Hospital; her children's education and occupations; a comparison of her experiences as a single woman during the 1908 depression and with a family during the Great Depression; the ethnic demographics of the different national and religious groups of the neighborhoods in which she lived and the shops in which she worked; and her work as an unlicensed private nurse until 1965.</p><p>Summary is available for this interview.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Women socialists |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref903" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henning, Astrid</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593242" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593242</unitid><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 May 7</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc2659bb35552376e42e667c3418162b" label="master reel [31142054875367]" type="box">96</container><container id="aspace_fe51ead1f47eae818f0aa894eceff1df" parent="aspace_bc2659bb35552376e42e667c3418162b" type="reel">903a - 903d</container><container id="aspace_5b6badb815905fbdc22da2ccefe7842a" label="master reel [31142054875375]" type="box">97</container><container id="aspace_013d81538a7cf32e1fa4337eaa161d65" parent="aspace_5b6badb815905fbdc22da2ccefe7842a" type="reel">903e - 903g</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_2cb23f48f6cab0415519dbb79601aae1" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_5bd356642bd1ddcf0195cc2b3093152f" parent="aspace_2cb23f48f6cab0415519dbb79601aae1" type="Folder">41</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/931zczq7" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Henning, Astrid: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Henning, Astrid: Audio Recording: 1975 May 7</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_c83bd62544290a38d90d208a52140bb8"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Astrid Henning was born in Norway.

The interview covers Clara Howard's early life in Hampton, Virginia; her family; and her opinions on racial discrimination and civil rights in the United States.  Howard discusses her education at the Gray School of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in her hometown, which she attended through the tenth grade.  She describes her family's home and explains that although they lived on a farm, they were near large cities, including Newport News and Norfolk, and did not live in an isolated area.</p><p>Howard explains that her older sisters migrated to New York and New Jersey and that she decided to migrate to New York when she was 16 years old after visiting.  She recounts living on 139th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan with her sisters in 1912; explains that African Americans were starting to move into Harlem at that time; and describes Harlem as beautiful, brightly lit, and clean.  She compares the living situation of minorities in downtown Manhattan to those in Harlem and her belief that the conditions downtown were more primitive than those in Hampton.  She compares her children's education to her own and discusses her opinion that she received a much better education as her teachers were black, took great interest in their students, and served as role models.  She recounts an incident of racial prejudice one of her children experienced, her reaction to it, and her feeling that this exemplified the failing of the educational system in New York.  </p><p>Howard discusses Marcus Garvey, Father Divine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, and describes them as great men.  She recounts attending services and lectures at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.  She discusses black empowerment, including black leaders encouraging the people to pull themselves up but not providing them with the tools to do so and her feeling that most people lack the desire for education.  She describes her pride in her education; her willingness to defend herself and family against racial discrimination and injustice; her amazement at the fact that so few people in her community were unwilling to make a similar stand; and her willingness to die for her beliefs.</p><p>Howard discusses her husband's first job with the United States Postal Service (USPS); the racial segregation within the USPS that led to his unhappiness; and his decision to start his own business.  She discusses her husband's jewelry and watch repair business in White Plains, New York, including the fact that the majority of his customers were white; his belief that his religious faith had enabled him to open his own business; and her management of the shop after he was injured in a car accident.</p><p>Other topics include leisure activities and holidays; theaters in Harlem, including the Alhambra; and Howard's enslaved grandparents who fled their owners before their two oldest children could be sold away from them.</p><p>See also: Council Workshop for Senior Citizens II.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref908" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hyman, Bella</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593246" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593246</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_0a5dc53026cd4e6e5d7e2af8efeea2aa" label="master reel [31142054875383]" type="box">98</container><container id="aspace_ae59e8f7fd951de26303ae6934256f29" parent="aspace_0a5dc53026cd4e6e5d7e2af8efeea2aa" type="reel">908a - 908b</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_855fd1bf9980237b10774442a005b2b8" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_a551841894e4d2009050bca821ab4a72" parent="aspace_855fd1bf9980237b10774442a005b2b8" type="Folder">43</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/1jwstxr1" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Hyman, Bella: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Hyman, Bella: Audio Recording: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_714b5eb979d7f393d7526eeb62d0616f"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Bella Hyman was born in a small town in Austria in the late 1890s.

The audio recording for this interview is missing.  Kearns notes that Kuthan had been frequently interviewed for local media and museums, and wrote a column in a nationally circulated Czech magazine.  The interview covers Kuthan's childhood and adolescence in Austria-Hungary and Czechoslovakia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1922; and her work in domestic service in both Europe and New York.</p><p>Kuthan describes the class structure in her hometown and compares the labor and conditions of the textile factory in which she and her family worked to the labor and conditions of the African-Americans who worked on plantations in the southern US.  She explains that her father was married twice and relates stories of how he met both of his wives.  She mentions that her father saved his money to send his children to Vienna, Austria, where he believed they had a better chance to be healthy and successful.  She describes her jobs in domestic service and recalls thinking that the US was a great country after retrieving American Red Cross food packages at a post office for one of her employers.  Other topics from her time in Europe include her siblings' occupations; living conditions in Austria during World War I (WWI); returning to Czechoslovakia after WWI; and her view of domestic work.</p><p>Kuthan explains that she convinced a man from her hometown to take her with him when he returned to his business in the US and describes her passage and arrival in Ellis Island, New York in 1922.  She describes finding work through a Czech employment agency on First Avenue between 72nd and 73rd Streets in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan and notes that Czech women often went into domestic work because they had no relatives in the US and thus needed a place to stay.  She recalls moving rapidly from one domestic service job to another in order to learn new things and improve her wages. She explains that many immigrants married because they wanted to have their own homes and to alleviate their homesickness.  She describes her marriage; her management of the household budget; and the family outings they took once her daughter was born.  Other topics from her time in the US include her first impressions of New York City; occupations of Czech immigrants and neighborhoods and areas where they lived; her husband's work as a carpenter; the differences between men and women's jobs in the household; and her love of food.</p><p>Summary is available for this interview.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">World War, 1914-1918 -- Austria</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref111" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lacowsky, [Unknown]</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344119" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344119</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_7bbd34fc9b0a5cbf72760dd06320bb7a" label="master reel [31142054874691]" type="box">29</container><container id="aspace_3b150abb406d11061664477cb5af3f37" parent="aspace_7bbd34fc9b0a5cbf72760dd06320bb7a" type="reel">111a</container><container id="aspace_8409860f1d2c6adf0e43dc540cdda9a6" label="master reel [31142054874709]" type="box">30</container><container id="aspace_e4a3a89ef2f79675b57f0414028273fe" parent="aspace_8409860f1d2c6adf0e43dc540cdda9a6" type="reel">111b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/wm37q2xz" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Lacowsky, [Unknown]" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Lacowsky, [Unknown]: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_f508782ac5ce7785bf38813089febf8b"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mr. Lacowsky was born in Russia in the late 19th century.

The location is unknown.  The volume fluctuates as the microphone moves between speakers during the interview.  This interview covers Molly and Jacob Newman's childhoods; their immigrations to the United States; and their work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  </p><p>Molly Newman begins the interview by describing the many variations of her first name across Russian, Hebrew, and English, including Manya, Malkah, Molly, and May.  She explains that she loves the United States (US) to the point where she would erase her Russian heritage if she could, recalling the often violent discrimination against Jews in Russia, and how this prompted her sister's immigration to the US.  She describes her immigration to the United States in 1912 and her work with her sister to earn enough money to send for their mother in 1914.  She recalls that her aunt helped her get her first job as a seamstress on Manhattan Avenue in New York City, noting that she was instructed to hide in the bathroom whenever a customer entered the shop because she looked too young to be working.  She recalls her membership in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 25; the organization of local garment shops; and strikes for better wages, which were often defeated by strikebreakers brought in by the employers.  She describes having an especially strong bond with Italian immigrants due to their shared immigrant experience and their work together membership in the ILGWU.  She recalls Communists attempting to infiltrate and disrupt the ILGWU by discussing irrelevant topics at meetings and fainting during organizational events.</p><p>Jacob Newman begins by describing his grandfather's wealth, which he acquired through his ready-made clothing business.  He recounts Communists taking his father's inheritance and this prompting his family's immigration to the US in search of better economic and educational opportunities.  He recalls his family wanting him to become a shochet, a person trained to slaughter animals according to Jewish law, but studying electrical engineering through the International Correspondence School instead.  He explains that General Electric would not hire him due to his Jewish heritage and so he sought work in the garment industry.  He recounts moving to Greenville, South Carolina at the behest of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in order to augment the development of the garment industry and the ACWA's presence in the southern US; sending his paychecks back to his family in New York; and visiting his family every two or three months.  He endeavors to explain his love of the southern US by describing the environment and the people, emphasizing his belief that African-Americans in the south were very educated.  Molly Newman frequently interjects with her disdain for the southern United States.  </p><p>Other topics include Communist activity in the US, particularly in labor unions; conditions during the Great Depression in New York City; race discrimination in the southern US; the benefits of membership in the Workmen's Circle; a comparison of the immigrant population in New York City in the past and at the time of the interview; the Newmans' 50th wedding anniversary party and the anniversary money they donated to the Women's American Organization for Rehabilitation through Training (ORT); and their daughter's education.</p><p>Summary and interview fact sheets are available for this interview.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Women socialists |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject><corpname source="naf">Socialist Party (U.S.)</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref153" level="file"><did><unittitle>O'Banyon, Bessie</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344161" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344161</unitid><unitdate normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974 April 30</unitdate><container id="aspace_47613bbed8a723337b52fee975af3d81" label="master reel [31142054874840]" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_f1ffbbc7d5ebb8d9beeebe6d4a8d68bd" parent="aspace_47613bbed8a723337b52fee975af3d81" type="reel">153a</container><container id="aspace_ea55b3e3832d23cf5d21213cb15d4e4a" label="master reel [31142054874857]" type="box">45</container><container id="aspace_54afbe658264700fb8974edbb79aa230" parent="aspace_ea55b3e3832d23cf5d21213cb15d4e4a" type="reel">153b - 153c</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/rn8pk6xb" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="O'Banyon, Bessie" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>O'Banyon, Bessie: 1974 April 30</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_4d9f5f7e74a5f8fdac2db5b066597ccc"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Rose Elizabeth (Bessie) O'Banyan was born in Toronto, Canada in 1903 and immigrated to the United States (US) with her family when she was a young child.

This interview covers Isidore Opochinsky's life in Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; his work as a fur machine operator in New York, New York; and his union activity.  Opochinsky tends to mumble and is sometimes hard to understand.  He provides few details about his childhood and early life in Europe, focusing on his involvement in the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.  He recalls that he learned of the importance of unionization and the tenets of Socialism through members of the Bund.  He notes that members of the Bund who immigrated to the US had an easier time acclimating because they had the resources and social ties of an organized group.  He explains that he worked without pay for six months while he trained in the fur industry in Europe.  He recounts immigrating to the US in 1921, because he could not make a living in Europe after World War I, and settling with his brother in New York, New York.  He explains that he returned to Europe after a conflict with an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union).  He discusses his return to the United States when he could not find work in Europe and his vow to rid the union of those in power who monopolized its funds and activities.  He recalls neglecting his education and his family in order to reorganize the leadership of the union, noting that after his removal of the corrupt leaders, the resulting chaos provided an opportunity for the Communists gain power.  He describes a strike that occurred in 1926, including the fact that it lasted 26 weeks; that the police killed many of the strikers; and that the strikers won, earning medical benefits and better hours and wages.  Other topics include details of the work of the fur industry; a comparison of labor unions and living and working conditions in Europe and the US; and his attendance and involvement in an unspecified conference concerned with Jewish labor issues in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>Summary is available for this interview.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Jewish socialists -- New York (State) -- New York -- Interviews.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Labor unions -- Officials and employees -- United States.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref156" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pane, Frank</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344164" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344164</unitid><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 April 30</unitdate><container id="aspace_a02866ef8906548fa14dc5d08a62c1aa" label="master reel [31142054874865]" type="box">46</container><container id="aspace_9d170dc0cee711bc309fb7fb32adccf1" parent="aspace_a02866ef8906548fa14dc5d08a62c1aa" type="reel">156a - 156b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/cfxpp34v" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Pane, Frank" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Pane, Frank: 1975 April 30</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_df8aecb710eb06801a2015e181bd7ae8"><head>Historical/Biographical Note</head><p>Frank Pane was born on March 21, 1891 in Sorrento, Italy.

In addition to Frank Pane, there is an unknown man who intermittently comments on the interviewers' questions.  This interview covers Pane's childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States, and his life and work as a bookbinder and longshoreman in New York, New York.  Pane discusses his family history, noting the contrast between his father, who was a relatively poor longshoreman, and his mother, who had inherited two large homes from her parents.  He recounts how his father's schooner was destroyed by a steamboat while at sea and how the steamboat crew, who were headed to the United States, brought him with them, and he settled in New York in order to acquire more job opportunities.  Pane and the rest of his family immigrated to the United States later in 1898 via the ship Victoria.  He describes the poor living conditions that many immigrants, including his family, endured.  He notes that during the the depressions before and after World War I, Father Vogel at the Saint Charles Chapel on Van Brunt and President Streets in Brooklyn, New York would distribute food and coal tickets to poor families.  He describes evading the draft during World War II in order to support his family and shifting his occupation from bookbinder to work as a caulker in the shipyards.  He notes that he liked the work due to the outdoor environment, a stark contrast to the dirty factories that he had worked in as a bookbinder, but disliked the inconsistent employment.  Pane emphasizes the politics of New York City, specifically the relationship between Democratic and Republican policies during the Great Depression.

The date is unknown.  This interview covers Robinson's childhood in British Guiana; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1924; and her life and work in New York, New York.  Robinson begins by describing her childhood in Plaisance, British Guiana, recalling how discipline and the desire to make something of herself were instilled in her through her household chores, education, and corporal punishment.  She describes the racial demographics of her classmates as being mostly black but not feeling animosity between the black and East Indian populations of British Guiana; and not experiencing racial discrimination and prejudice until she lived in the US.  She discusses Great Britain's relationship with British Guiana and her work as secretary in a Marcus Garvey club in British Guiana.  </p><p>Robinson recalls wanting to come to the US because she had heard that American stenographers earned good wages.  She describes her journey to the US in March 1924, during which she felt seasick and alone, and nearly died when her ship sank.  She recalls living with her friend's sister on 128th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and her awe at seeing snow for the first time.  She recounts a trip she and her husband took to the southern US after they were married, focusing on her initial experience with racial discrimination in the US and how it made her wary of people.  She describes moving near Linden Boulevard in Brooklyn  in order to provide a safer environment and better educational opportunities for her children.  </p><p>Robinson explains that she went into factory work because the hours allowed her to care for her children and that one of her friends taught her to operate a sewing machine.  She recalls working for various garment factories and joining Local 140 of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union), which supported members financially during strikes and helped them achieve better working conditions and wages.

Rocco begins the interview by describing his childhood in Italy; his father's cargo ship business; and the changes in Procida from when he left to the time of the interview, noting an increase in educational opportunities and a decrease in the number of people employed in labor-intensive jobs.  He discusses being encouraged to immigrate to the US after seeing the success of his father's workers who would go to the US and return to Italy wealthier.  He explains that his immigration in July 1924 impeded him from acquiring his citizenship until 1948.  He recounts his settling on 2nd Street in Brooklyn with his cousin's family and immediately working as a longshoreman.  He recalls joining the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) but notes that its early incarnations were weak and indistinct due to its lack of communication and organization, especially during the Great Depression.  He discusses the fact that longshoremen were predominantly Italian and notes that the large need for the occupation dwindled over time and will perhaps completely disappear in the future.  He describes living in a predominantly Italian neighborhood in which there were many large families of four to five children and that the older generations made sure to pass the traditions of their homeland to the next generation.  Other topics include his marriage and subsequent move to 49th Street and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn in 1929; his first time taking the 7th Avenue subway in 1924; and his belief in building a better life for himself in the US.</p><p>Subject cards are available for this interview.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref170" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rockwell, Alfonso</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344178" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344178</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_6a5d64b3c93b395f0926e6271af130df" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_12d751ed11f653939b8bcf410e41e350" parent="aspace_6a5d64b3c93b395f0926e6271af130df" type="Folder">103</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_56a1d6d002992b519f3c90d94f589e16"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Alfonso Rockwell was born in North Cumberland County, Virginia in 1907.

The location is likely the Carroll Gardens Senior Center at 380 Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.  Many people can be heard conversing over one another and passing in and out of the room, making the current narrator hard to hear.  Several other people were present at this interview including Frances and Rose, who are only identified by their first names; Lily (likely Lily Campanile); an unspecified man who acts as a translator between the interviewer and Stella Loregio; and several other unidentified women.  This interview covers the history of  Adele Rosanno's father; Rosanno's life in Brooklyn, New York; parts of Stella Loregio's life and work; and several unnamed participants' stories of their lives and work experiences in the United States (US).  </p><p>Rosanno begins by describing her father; his immigration to the US from Italy in 1889; and his inheritance of his father's farm in the Abruzzi region of Italy.  She describes his struggle to find work as a cabinetmaker in the US, noting that he worked on the subway in New York City before getting a job at E. B. Jordan, a furniture company, where he later became a floor manager.  Rosanno recounts meeting her husband at a masquerade dance; working as a manager in his restaurant on Houston Street; and monitoring the bar and wait staff as they had a tendency to steal from the business.  Other topics from Rosanno's portion of the interview include her family and their educations and occupations; her job as a saleswoman; and her involvement with the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary &amp; Saint Stephen Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn.  </p><p>Rosanno introduces her friend, identified as Rose, who discusses the types of community organizations in Carroll Gardens and emphasizes the role of religious organizations.  She notes that many of the volunteers were older women who no longer worked, but needed  to socialize and keep busy.  She focuses on the contributions of those in the Jeanmen's Guild of Saint Agnes Church and the volunteer work that went into making bed jackets for Saint Rose's Free Home for Incurable Cancer at 71 Jackson Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  </p><p>All of the women describe their impressions of how the role of women has changed since they were young women, specifically noting the increasing number of women in the workforce.  One woman recalls working as a telephone operator until her marriage and wishes she had continued working after raising her children because she liked her job.  The women compare their children to the generation of children at the time of the interview, remarking that children have become more spoiled but also more intelligent.  Many of them note that they knew nothing about sex or pregnancy until they married because their parents felt that children should not be exposed to such knowledge.  In contrast, they observe how the generation of children at the time of the interview know more about these topics than they did at the same age.  </p><p>Stella Loregio speaks predominantly in Italian, with an unidentified man acting as a translator at the very end of her narrative.  She describes her immigration to the US; parts of her family history; her husband's family and his death; a trip she made to Italy and her return to the US in 1950; and the life of her children at the time of the interview.  </p><p>Other topics discussed in the general interview include Italian mourning traditions, particularly those affiliated with widows, and many of the women's trips to Italy, both in the past and at the time of the interview.</p><p>See also: Campanile, Lily.</p><p>Summary is available for this interview.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref173" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rothman, Helen Taub</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344181" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344181</unitid><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 May 9</unitdate><container id="aspace_e3b543bb0e571027e2bbc011736e7063" label="master reel [31142054874923]" type="box">52</container><container id="aspace_7b75bad557f35457865713fb0acbdb4e" parent="aspace_e3b543bb0e571027e2bbc011736e7063" type="reel">173a</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_b50caa99ae4854aa11a169b9fcc5782c" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_886f13720d64b95dbc9d1a2da7967680" parent="aspace_b50caa99ae4854aa11a169b9fcc5782c" type="Folder">74</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/f7m0cp4s" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rothman, Helen Taub: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Rothman, Helen Taub: Audio Recording: 1973 May 9</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_47698cbdcd0fd23b9418497a616538ee"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Helen Rothman was born in 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but was raised in a small town in Hungary.

This interview covers Alex Sirota's working life, his union activity, and his early life in Romania.  Sirota discusses his membership and work as an organizer in an unspecified furniture workers' union and the affiliation of that union with the Furniture Workers Industrial Union in 1936.  He describes the creation of the United Furniture Workers of America (UFWA) in 1937 and the affiliation of his local with them.  He describes his work to unionize the factory at which he worked for the UFWA; a 26 week strike that followed the unionization of that factory; and he and his daughter being threatened by representatives of his employer.  He describes the ethnic and racial demographics of the original membership of the UFWA (predominantly Jewish) and the membership at the time of the interview (predominantly black and Puerto Rican).  He recounts meetings of the general membership being conducted and recorded in Yiddish, with the minority learning Yiddish in order to participate.  He discusses cultivating certain workers to be union officers; officers continuing to work in the shops as an officer's salary was not enough to live on; and this leading to officers having a better understanding of the needs of the general membership.  He discusses the union leadership at the time of the interview being paid a substantial salary and not having to continue working in the factories, which he felt led to a separation of the leadership from the general membership and inferior management of the union.  </p><p>Sirota discusses his early life in Romania, including his memories of the Russian Revolution; anti-Semitism in Romania; and his decision to emigrate.  He describes the importance of union officials' dedication to the union over their own personal interests; of the union possessing both organizational and political power; and of the general decline in union membership at the time of the interview.  Other topics include a trip he took through France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union in 1951; his two appearances before the House Un-American Activities Committee; the role of the Communist Party of the United States of America in the labor movement; a trip he took to Israel in 1966; his parents' immigration and acclimation to the US; the dangers associated with being a member of the union; his interest in a Jewish paper and Jewish literature; his wife's occupation as a garment worker and member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; and his opinions of the youth movements occurring at the time of the interview.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Furniture workers -- Labor unions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Jews, Romanian -- United States -- Interviews</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref187" level="file"><did><unittitle>Smith, Mozelle</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344195" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344195</unitid><unitdate normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974 May 2</unitdate><container id="aspace_c8d72d84cc492815dec3179d65dea01c" label="master reel [31142054874964]" type="box">56</container><container id="aspace_8f4f3a0b65b95191cb1ae724791e563d" parent="aspace_c8d72d84cc492815dec3179d65dea01c" type="reel">187a - 187c</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/4qrfjdw5" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Smith, Mozelle" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Smith, Mozelle: 1974 May 2</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_d0fee5c4eed34e5ea6d180d3cd85a5e1"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mozelle Smith was born Marcella Gale at 504 West 125th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.

The location is likely Mozelle Smith's apartment.  Gigi often provides long anecdotes of her own.  This interview covers Smith's childhood in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; her education; her work in domestic service; part of her mother's life in Chesterfield County, Virginia; a discussion between herself and Gigi about religion; and Smith's musings on how New York City and its inhabitants have changed since her childhood.  </p><p>Smith begins the interview by recounting how she received her nickname, Mozelle, in school and how the name has stayed with her.  She describes growing up in Harlem and specifically focuses on living in racially mixed areas, both on 125th Street and 127th Street.  She explains the impact this had on her education experience, noting that the first school she attended, Public School (PS) 43, was a predominantly white school, where the teachers treated her well, but she often fought with other students when they called her racial slurs.  She recalls that when she transferred to PS 157, she expected to be treated fairly because there were more black students, but they ostracized her because she lived in a white neighborhood, which prompted fights with them.  Smith recounts her mother not understanding her aggressive reaction to racial slurs and attributes this to her being accustomed to such treatment due to growing up in Virginia.  She recounts her mother's time in Virginia and her experience migrating to New York; her mother's job as a chambermaid near Columbia University in Manhattan; the difference in the ways in which lighter and darker skinned black people were treated; and her experience at church and Sunday school.  </p><p>Smith and Gigi have a long discussion concerning religion, covering topics such as the difference in the way the black community and others practice religion; whether such a delineation should exist; changes in the importance of religion for both groups; and the impact of slavery and African traditions on the development of black spirituality.  Other topics include Smith's musings on changes in New York City since her childhood; Spanish becoming as important a language as English in the United States at the time of the interview; her reasons for never having children; and comparing the connotations of being referred to as black or negro.</p></scopecontent></c><c audience="internal" id="aspace_ref332" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sotello, Lebuncio</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344642" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344642</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_78886468b4cf4fccea0cb3663e785e82" label="master cassette [31142054875409]" type="box">100</container><container id="aspace_d0057cb929957c2331dcbed2e1c327d7" parent="aspace_78886468b4cf4fccea0cb3663e785e82" type="cassette">332</container><container id="aspace_6560dfb5aba820d7af5aff08b757a7cb" label="master reel [31142054875151]" type="box">75</container><container id="aspace_9c635358aeb863205de19fb985854595" parent="aspace_6560dfb5aba820d7af5aff08b757a7cb" type="reel">332a</container><container id="aspace_2af13509e1fcad3bbe5bd135d74ce1ec" label="master reel [31142054874840]" type="box">44</container><container id="aspace_3ba73683db4489568b87a42d19bec508" parent="aspace_2af13509e1fcad3bbe5bd135d74ce1ec" type="reel">332b/150a</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/0vt4bgkg" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Sotello, Lebuncio" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Sotello, Lebuncio: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did></c><c id="aspace_ref188" level="file"><did><unittitle>Stackhouse, Ollie</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344196" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344196</unitid><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 November 11 and December 1</unitdate><container id="aspace_d3a2a1e8851b5f29c0ae090bb1450685" label="master reel [31142054874972]" type="box">57</container><container id="aspace_44f231c744204ab736f17df866aae408" parent="aspace_d3a2a1e8851b5f29c0ae090bb1450685" type="reel">188a - 188e</container><container id="aspace_b4618400d39b4e59a0f1ec6e2d5f4f27" label="master reel [31142054874980]" type="box">58</container><container id="aspace_ebd103c32ef4a46386aba95280d5c5d6" parent="aspace_b4618400d39b4e59a0f1ec6e2d5f4f27" type="reel">188f - 188i</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/12jm6b2w" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Stackhouse, Ollie" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Stackhouse, Ollie: 1975 November 11 and December 1</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_482eacce8aca2376b53a4f0f859f4bb4"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Ollie Stackhouse was born in Rippon, West Virginia in 1912.

The location is likely Ollie Stackhouse's home.  The volume fluctuates and sometimes cuts out before resuming after a few seconds.  This interview covers Stackhouse's childhood in Rippon, West Virginia; her migrations to Maryland, New Jersey, and New York; and her work as a domestic employee, cook, and factory worker.  Stackhouse begins by describing her childhood in Rippon, West Virginia, noting that she had a tight-knit, self-sufficient family.  She explains that the black community accounted for half of the population in Rippon and notes that race relations were relatively cordial despite segregation in the town.  She discusses the history of parts of her family; descriptions of where each of her sisters settled; her family's domestic work for and relationship with the Long family in Rippon; and religious and secular holidays and traditions.</p><p>Stackhouse explains that her desire to leave Rippon came from listening to stories many of her sisters and neighbors related about living in various cities, including New York, New York.  She describes moving to Baltimore, Maryland and living with her sisters on Madison Avenue near Druid Hill Park.  She recalls different families for whom she worked; her cleaning responsibilities; her ability to create her own schedule; and leaving one employer because of her racist attitude.  She discusses working in a department store, a job she found better than domestic work because of its health benefits and worker's compensation.  She discusses the stigma associated with domestic work; her and her family's living and working conditions during the Great Depression; dating practices in Baltimore during the 1930s and 40s; the way in which she met and married her husband; and the limited job opportunities available to the black population in the 1940s.</p><p>Stackhouse explains that she moved to New Jersey after her husband was discharged from the Army after World War II and that she acquired domestic work with a family who brought her to New York, New York in 1945.  She describes other industries in which she worked, including as a cook at the Rainbow Room at 30 Rockefeller Center in Manhattan; a packer in a garment factory; and as a saleswoman in Macy's.  She notes that she enjoyed these jobs more than domestic work because they had less restrictions and allowed her to meet a wide variety of people.  She recalls having to adjust her work schedule after her son was born in 1952, giving up her job at Macy's to take care of him when she was unable find a reputable babysitter.  Other topics include her husband's employment as a presser in the garment industry and his work for Con Edison; the ways in which women raised families and navigated discriminatory practices at work; a comparison of life in a city and in the country; a comparison of life in the southern and northern United States (US); the typical sequence of a family's migration from the southern to the northern US; and her frequent visits to her remaining family in West Virginia.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref189" level="file"><did><unittitle>Stanley, Mary Belle</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344197" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344197</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_b6d48ffdb94b881d0c2ee90400a08947" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_840938bd9f180ba58015e615d3ca0f4a" parent="aspace_b6d48ffdb94b881d0c2ee90400a08947" type="Folder">107</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_e2fe7dfd357cff47ad38c740e877d1d6"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mary Belle Stanley was born Hyde County, North Carolina.

Other topics include the relationships between different immigrant populations where he lived and worked; New York City politics, predominantly focusing on Fiorello La Guardia and Vito Marcantonio; the surge in Puerto Rican migration to the United States in the 1940s; Puerto Rican involvement in politics; the development of labor unions, with emphasis on the inclusion of immigrant and minority groups; the mechanization of bakery work and its impact on bakers; his leisure time activities; and a comparison between the importance of religion to his generation of Puerto Ricans and younger generations.</p><p>See also:  Ethnicity; Family; Leisure; Politics; and Unionization.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Puerto Ricans |x Cultural assimilation |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref197" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tossio, Primo</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344205" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344205</unitid><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 April 8</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_769ed4cdc2be30bc4330a0593f1b6f8a" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_b792e3d8f32f4dd6fa620bfe2a22df34" label="master reel [31142054875029]" type="box">62</container><container id="aspace_9bf87c0be16f4880e1a46d9d9667a02b" parent="aspace_b792e3d8f32f4dd6fa620bfe2a22df34" type="reel">197a - 197b</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_cc98d34592aa35f86b21bc77ffc7c645" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_d58776de5b98d2c309bd70bb62663915" parent="aspace_cc98d34592aa35f86b21bc77ffc7c645" type="Folder">85</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/02v6x3vv" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Tossio, Primo: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Tossio, Primo: Audio Recording: 1975 April 8</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_418ae63728e8ce5ecf52811eed02da7e"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Primo Tossio was born in Rome, Italy and was the oldest of eight children.

Her mother died when she was one and a half years old and her father died five years later.  She was raised by her stepmother before being sent to various relatives, one of whom abused her, which prompted one her teachers to gain custody of her.  She attended school in Vienna as well as other schools in northern Austria.  She married Rudolph Unger in 1912 when she was 15 years old.  They immigrated to the United States on December 24, 1920, staying with her brother-in-law before getting their own apartment on 65th Street and 1st Avenue in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She worked as a domestic worker; as a worker in a perfume factory, as the chef, manager, and owner of Viennese restaurants in both New Hampshire and New York; and as a pattern maker and department head at McCall's.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_c6059ff3f2ee539e186e215f87aa3680"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This interview was conducted by Scott Weir at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York on April 23 and May 8, 1974.  This interview covers Margareta Unger's childhood in Austria; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1920; and her life and work in the US up to the time of the interview.  Unger begins by describing her childhood in Austria; her father's remarriage after her mother's death; his death, which left Unger with her stepmother, who was soon unable to care for her; and her movement among a series of relatives, one of whom physically abused her.  She describes returning to Vienna to attend high school; meeting her husband in a coffeehouse; and emphasizing her stepmother's disapproval in the difference in their ages.  She recalls renouncing her religion for her husband and enduring a protracted court battle to sever her stepmother's guardianship over her.  She explains that her husband's wealth was seized by the state as funds for World War I (WWI); her poverty during WWI; her immigration to Russia in 1917 after her husband was drafted into the Austrian Army and stationed there; and their illegal immigration back to Austria in order to avoid the Russian Revolution.</p><p>Unger explains that many of her husband's siblings already lived in the US and that one brother returned to Austria to bring them back to the US.  She recalls being frightened by the amount of brick houses in the US, thinking that these buildings were all jails, and living in a house with steam heat, a luxury reserved for the rich in Austria.  She notes that she was able to acclimate more easily to the US than her husband; quickly finding work as a domestic worker; renting a hotel in New Hampshire during one summer so that she could set up her own Viennese restaurant; struggling to find consistent employment; and teaching her husband English so he could become a chauffeur.  She recalls visiting her brothers-in-law in Brodhead, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois in 1934 and 1935 and her husband encouraging her to help them grow their business.  Unger discusses opening another restaurant on 280 Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan, where she worked as the chef and manager while her husband worked the cash register and washed the dishes.  She recalls food shortages during World War II forcing them to close; finding work as a pattern-maker and later department head at McCall's; working with the pantograph machine; and disguising patterns sent to England so the company could avoid taxes.  Other topics include her interactions with the local authorities and the mafia in New York City; her trips to Austria and other European countries; her husband's illnesses and death; her health; and her volunteer activities after her retirement.</p><p>See also:  Life Before Immigration or Migration;  Immigration, Migration, and First Impressions of New York, New York and the United States; and Politics.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref190" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unidentified African-American man</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344198" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344198</unitid><unitdate type="inclusive">1973 May 21</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_dd2ec1b24299d6b334b28153b7d9c600" label="access cd [31142054875417]" type="box">101</container><container id="aspace_be905bb719ba1229c56cf9a2f32ca12c" label="master reel [31142054874980]" type="box">58</container><container id="aspace_37ecab13d157fd1c5f072034442edc3a" parent="aspace_be905bb719ba1229c56cf9a2f32ca12c" type="reel">190a</container><container id="aspace_2ccc599dd335e35c01eb4dfd12fa043f" label="master reel [31142054874998]" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_13cb33ea32f83e8bbf4a335e152a8aa7" parent="aspace_2ccc599dd335e35c01eb4dfd12fa043f" type="reel">190b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/w9ghx9rv" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Unidentified African-American man" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Unidentified African-American man: 1973 May 21</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_99b7f2a9535421e1ccba689dcb8f870e"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This interview was conducted by Eric Perkins on May 21, 1973.  The narrator and location of this interview are unknown.  The narrator of this interview does not provide any information about himself.  This interview covers the reasons for black migration within the United States (US); the history of black sociopolitical movements; and the living and social conditions of black populations in northern cities in the US.  The narrator describes reasons black families would migrate from the southern US to the north, including a boll weevil infestation that severely damaged the cotton crop during the 1920s; the repression of minorities in the south; better education opportunities in the north; positive accounts from relatives; the economic opportunities created by the decreased immigration from Europe during World War I; and the idealistic mythology surrounding the north.  He recounts the ways in which racial segregation in the south gave rise to a black middle class that worked toward fulfilling the needs of the black community.  He elaborates on different sociopolitical movements that occurred between the Civil War and the time of the interview, noting that each of these developments assigned importance to different aspects of black life. He discusses Garveyism, the Tuskegee movement, the Niagara movement, and the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Topics relating to these movements include the liberation of black people; the immigrationist movements; the development of the foundation of a strong black economy; and the legal struggles for social and political equality.  The narrator focuses on the logistics of the typical migration, including how a single family member, usually a young man, would establish the living and financial situation before the rest of the family moved.  He explains that black families typically settled in what he referred to as the black belts of the city, crowded areas with poor living conditions that were eventually alleviated by public housing projects.  Other topics include the exclusionary tendencies of labor unions, which led to black employees developing their own unions, especially for unskilled labor; the differences between the older and younger generations' forms of leisure and entertainment, and the differences between white and black families with the extended family playing a much larger role in black families.</p><p>See also:  Interview Compilation for Radio Broadcast.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref355" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unidentified Italian-American woman</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="592028" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">592028</unitid><unitdate normal="1973/1973">1973</unitdate><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/b5mkm3qp" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Unidentified Italian-American woman" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Unidentified Italian-American woman: 1973-</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_86965dc9fde5c19aaf2eddb59827eac6"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>The narrator is not identified by name.

Antonio Uttaro and the interviewer occasionally speak in Italian.  This interview covers Uttaro's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life in Boston, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York up to the time of the interview.  Uttaro describes his childhood and young adult life as being influenced by liberal politics, recounting listening to Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta speak in his hometown and how he developed a strong dislike for rules and organization.  He describes immigrating to the US as a way to become independent of his family, particularly of his father's strict household rules.  He recalls his first moments in the US as frightening, describing how a stranger had to help him locate his cousin in Somerville, Massachusetts after he got off the train in Boston.  He recounts his life in Pittsburgh with his sister; his return to Boston; and his dual responsibilities as a presser working in a tailor shop during the day and as a student at night.  He describes his work as a presser as being seasonal and having to find various other jobs during the off-season.  He recounts marrying his wife in 1924; moving to New York by himself in 1927 to pursue better employment opportunities; and sending for his family a few months later.  He notes that he had no desire to become an American citizen until his son became upset about admitting at school that his father was not a citizen, and that doing so ostracized him from some of his Socialist friends.  He describes becoming a member of both the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 89 and the Industrial Workers of the World, detailing the growth of the ILGWU despite tension between the Socialists and Communists within the union.  Throughout his interview, Uttaro emphasizes the practicality of compromise, noting that even though he was an active member of the union and a Socialist, he tended to criticize his affiliates when he believed they were pursuing their ideals to extremes.  He discusses taking part in a program through the union in which he visited older union members who lived alone after he retired at age 65.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Socialists |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref206" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vercelino, [Unknown]</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344214" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344214</unitid><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 April 25</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_20d18859d0482ec6ed0699cc6b31c2bc" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_3d442adb6451839eab42de1b7d93f3ce" parent="aspace_20d18859d0482ec6ed0699cc6b31c2bc" type="Folder">86</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/z34tmwsx" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Vercelino, [Unknown]: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Vercelino, [Unknown]: Audio Recording: 1973 April 25</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_a21628d1b91677d861ae24af06a62e3a"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>The first name of the narrator is unknown.

This interview covers Walters' childhood in Saint Kitts; her immigration to the US;, her marriages and children; and her working life, predominantly as a nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Brooklyn.  Walters begins by briefly describing her childhood in Saint Kitts, noting that she lived with her grandparents, aunt, uncle, and sister; and that her grandfather owned his own land.  She discusses her immigration to the US in 1917, including making herself appear older in order to board the ship; enduring the eight day voyage alone; and being unable to eat much.  Walters describes settling in Jersey City with her mother and stepfather, who were the superintendents of a 60 family apartment building, and how she started working rather than continuing her education.  She explains that she got her first job working as a telephone operator in her apartment building and was later hired as a nurse for the children of the Lerner family in Jersey City.  Walters explains that the Lerners and their staff treated her like family, and that the chauffeur and chef took a particular interest in her.  She recounts meeting and marrying a chauffeur from Virginia in 1922, noting that she separated from him when he lost his job during the Great Depression and had no inclination to find another one.  </p><p>Walters discusses her and her children's move to New York, where she worked various jobs before marrying her second husband, who served in the Army, during World War II; traveling back and forth between the US and Germany with him between 1951 and 1956; and adopting another child in Germany.  She describes taking a course in nursing while she lived in Fort Benning from 1956 to 1962; working night shifts as a baby nurse at the Brooklyn Community Hospital for 11 years when the family moved back to New York; and augmenting the household income when her husband retired from the Army.  She recalls joining an unspecified union while at the hospital (likely Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union) but notes that her hospital did not go on strike because the administration acquiesced to their demands once they saw what was happening in other hospitals in the area.  She describes her duties as a baby nurse and emphasizes the friendly relationship among the staff members in the hospital.  Other topics include the lives and occupations of her children; her living conditions during the Great Depression; and racial discrimination in Georgia.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref993" level="file"><did><unittitle>Walters, [Unknown Man]</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593522" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593522</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_21ac09a0a5443f064b5202c9233a9347" label="master reel [31142054875391]" type="box">99</container><container id="aspace_88db603cce33f58e0320d01c3308c221" parent="aspace_21ac09a0a5443f064b5202c9233a9347" type="reel">993a</container><container id="aspace_9f5b5f1cba842d683ae5062c02b44cc3" label="master reel [31142054875169]" type="box">76</container><container id="aspace_022ebdece6312c888b1d709fc038afb5" parent="aspace_9f5b5f1cba842d683ae5062c02b44cc3" type="reel">993b</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/hhmgqvtx" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Walters, [Unknown Man]" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Walters, [Unknown Man]: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_612f116458644400b09821c786bb747c"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mr. Walters was born in Jamaica in 1895.

The first name of the narrator is unknown.  This interview covers Mr. Walters' childhood in Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US) when he was 19 years old; and his life and work in the construction industry in New York, New York.  Walters begins by describing the reason his family immigrated to the US, noting that his family moved primarily due to economic conditions.  He explains that many of his relatives had already immigrated to the US and some of his immediate family and distant relatives followed his family after their immigration.  He notes that the family made sure to help any new members adjust to life in the US.  He recalls attending an unspecified vocational school at which he learned carpentry, and working in the construction industry as a carpenter and mechanic.  He recalls working on the George Washington Bridge, Madison Square Garden, The Daily News Building, the subway in Queens, and schools near the City College of New York.  He joined an unspecified construction workers' union in New York City, which he remembers specifically for its assistance in reducing working hours.  Walters lived in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan and noticed that, while he felt safe in his neighborhood, there was a divide between the white and black populations.  He emphasizes the role of the sanitation workers in New York City, explaining that he believes that they are more important than the police because they keep the city clean.  He notes that while gangsters have consistently been a problem in New York City, narcotics have made the generation coming of age at the time of the interview more violent and destructive than their predecessors.  Other topics include his family's religion; a comparison of the relevance of the church in the past and at the time of the interview; the importance of a construction worker's tools; his experience during the Prohibition era; racial and ethnic segregation and discrimination in New York City neighborhoods; his leisure time in a book club; and a comparison of New York City in the past and at the time of the interview.</p><p>See also: Council Workshop for Senior Citizens II; and Interview Compilation for Radio Broadcast.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Construction workers -- New York (State) -- New York -- Interviews</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref211" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wanderling, Angelina</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="344219" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">344219</unitid><unitdate>Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_767c8f73581704324f15e3845e4a348c" label="master reel [31142054875094]" type="box">69</container><container id="aspace_23c748af38fb3658ca2126ab504cdf47" parent="aspace_767c8f73581704324f15e3845e4a348c" type="reel">211a - 211d</container><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_b8b74d80fd2ddf1ac11a2bf69d706a4f" label="Mixed Materials [31142054861714]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_9297d147e9fd69ee6ce47f6b7010391e" parent="aspace_b8b74d80fd2ddf1ac11a2bf69d706a4f" type="Folder">89</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/9cnp5qw8" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Wanderling, Angelina: Audio Recording" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Wanderling, Angelina: Audio Recording: Undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><bioghist id="aspace_5857537a43799c68f02cfb77d0d7d422"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Angelina Wanderling was born in 1902 in New York, New York.

This interview covers Ellen Williams' childhood in Darliston, Jamaica; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life and work as a baby nurse and a nurses' aide in New York, New York.  Williams begins by describing her childhood in Jamaica, specifically recalling her father's occupation as a coachman in Kingston; the perception of this job as prestigious due to the wages and uniforms; and his occupation later as a pimento and coffee farmer in Darliston.  She recalls that despite the racial segregation in the schools and churches, children were generally friendly with one another.  She describes working as a baby nurse for a family in Jamaica, noting that they treated her like family; deferred to her on matters regarding their children; and introduced her to politicians and other friends of theirs.  She discusses the differences between life in the city and in the country; the different roles of men and women in both the household and society; the finances of her household; Catholic traditions, including holiday services and the role of godparents; and other secular traditions, particularly birthdays and festivals.</p><p>Williams explains that she immigrated to the US at the behest of her cousin and recalls the sponsorship and monetary requirements for her immigration in June 1947.  Her initial impression of New York City was that it was filled with trees and well-dressed people.  She explains that while her cousins helped her to acclimate to life in New York, she had difficulty adapting to the winter weather.  She describes working as a baby nurse for various families in New York City, recalling that after her marriage in 1948, she only took jobs that did not require her to live with her employers.  She describes her work and training as a nurse's aide at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Williams recalls joining Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1963 or 1964 and notes that despite her initial skepticism of its benefits, the union gave hospital workers greater job security and wage increases.  Other topics include the differences between her work as a baby nurse and nurse's aide; her siblings' education, careers, and families; her husband's occupation and family; her interactions with and impressions of union leaders, particularly Doris Turner and Leon Davis; her involvement in the West Indian and American Friendly Society and St. John's Lodge; and her visits to Jamaica to see her family.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Jamaicans |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.</subject></controlaccess></c></c><c audience="internal" id="aspace_49435c3223aa7c1a2704a50fcedd41ec" level="series"><did><unittitle>Preservation Masters</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_c900ea4bd1dffb016d11786d7122bd8f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Preservation Masters</unittitle><unitdate normal="1972/1976" type="inclusive">1972-1976, undated</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_a019c3e9cc4878be394407a7f7fc74a2" label="master cassette [31142054612299]" type="Box">102</container></did><scopecontent audience="internal" id="aspace_38aaef7107321c5efb0d37e1163aa737"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Cassettes 1 -
