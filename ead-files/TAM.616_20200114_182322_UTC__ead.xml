    <abstract id="aspace_cc23d6d697b3ecd496f3796631a3e705">Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. Estela and Ernesto Bravo moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length features and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution. This collection has been partially digitized, and only the digitized footage is currently accessible to researchers.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. The Bravos moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela Bravo's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. Bravo's documentaries have aired on television networks including PBS (US), CBC (Canada), Channel 4 (UK) Canal Plus (France), and at international film festivals and retrospectives honoring her work.</p><p>Estela Bravo was born on June 8, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. The youngest of three daughters, she was raised in a family of working-class European immigrants. Estela worked for the Furriers Union while studying sociology at night at Brooklyn College. In 1953 she helped organize a group called Students for a Peaceful World. She attended the 3rd World Student Congress in Warsaw, Poland as a representative for the Students for a Peaceful World, where she met Ernesto Bravo.</p><p>Ernesto Mario Bravo (1929- ) was born in Argentina on April 7, 1929. Bravo studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1951, while still a student, he was targeted by the state police for his participation in a student strike and tried on charges of organizing anti-government student activities. </p><p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo married in January of 1956. They moved to Cuba in 1963 after Ernesto was offered a position as a Professor of Biochemistry at the Medical School of the University of Havana. In Cuba, Estela Bravo worked at the cultural institution Casa de las Américas where she organized programs promoting folk and protest music. She later began developing television programs and creating short documentaries based on archival footage, which documented notable figures like the Rosenbergs, Malcolm X, and Paul Robeson. Ernesto wrote many of the scripts for these short films. Estela Bravo completed her first full-length documentary in 1980, <emph render="italic">Those Who Left</emph>, which told the story of Cubans who left the island after the 1959 revolution. In addition to his teaching career, Ernesto Bravo has worked collaborator with his wife on her many documentary films, and has written a number of books, including <emph render="italic">Modern Medicine in Cuba</emph> (1995) and <emph render="italic">Development within Underdevelopment: New Trends in Cuban Medicine</emph> (1998).</p><p>As of 2016, Estela and Ernesto Bravo continue to make films. In 2014, they were honored in South Africa by the Mandela Foundation, they released films about Gabriel García Márquez and Commander Juan Almeida, and they updated their 2007 film, <emph render="italic">Who am I?

    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>Upon receipt of this collection, Tamiment Library discovered that many of the videos had mold damage or binder hydrolysis. Several tapes have been repaired and digitized, but many have yet to receive treatment. The digitization process remains ongoing.</p><p>To facilitate preservation treatment, all tapes were initially inventoried and assigned a persistent identifier, which is listed in the finding aid as the "ref" number. These numbers are not sequential and are not listed in a specific order. Individual tapes have been arranged intellectually by the full-length feature in which they appear. Tapes were originally received in boxes containing packing slips that roughly associated footage with specific films. Much of this contextual information was lost, however, due to the immediate separation of materials for preservation treatment. Information about footage content and associated feature film(s) has been reconstructed to the best of the archivist's ability through analysis of container annotations, research, and consultation with the donors. Footage has been added to the series that best represents the context of its use. Estela Bravo frequently reused footage in multiple documentaries, and consequently some footage may be duplicated in more than one series.</p><p>Videos were sent for preservation treatment in multiple installments, which resulted in several non-sequential box numbers. In 2016, box numbers were updated and listed in sequential order. </p><p>Titles of digitized videos have been edited or supplied by the archivist based on the content of the recording. Titles of videos that have yet to be digitized have been derived from annotations on the individual film containers and associated notes. The descriptions of video cassettes that have not yet been digitized often contain phrases in quotation marks. These phrases were copied from annotations on the cassette boxes. As digitized versions of the videos become available, descriptions are being updated.</p><p>Many of the videos in this collection were undated. The majority of the dates have been estimated by the archivist based on release date of the film or the event documented in the footage.</p><p>Two additional donations of ephemera, publications, transcripts, and promotional materials were donated in 2014 and 2015. Documents associated with specific films were incorporated the existing series, while publications and ephemera more generally associated with filmmaking and Estela Bravo's career were added as Series XXX: Collected Ephemera and Publications. Films reels documenting moments in Estela and Ernesto Bravo's personal lives were added as Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p><p>In 2016 videos stored on a hard drive and flash drive were forensically imaged and analyzed. Duplicate copies of full-length documentaries were deaccessioned and remaining videos were incorporated into series based on the documentaries with which they correspond.</p><p>In 2017, a copy of the documentary <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph> was added to the collection as Series XXXII: <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>.</p><p>In 2018, 255 videos were digitized and described at the item-level.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Estela and Ernesto Bravo Film and Video Collection (dates 1959-2014) contains interviews, footage, and full-length films from documentaries created by filmmaker Estela Bravo between the 1980s and early 2000s. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length documentaries and video footage, the collection also contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of important events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; historical clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage was primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution.</p><p>Many of Bravo's films focus broadly on Cuba after the revolution and its relationship with the United States and other countries. Bravo's films address other issues related to Latin American politics and culture, exploring topics such as: children abducted during Argentina's "Dirty War;" Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship; the assassination of Maurice Bishop in Grenada; social and economic problems caused by Latin American debts owed to the United States; struggles to end apartheid in South Africa; and a 1984 concert featuring Cuban musicians Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes in Buenos Aires.</p><p>The most extensive footage comes from <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and its follow-up <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>. There are more than 400 video recordings related to these films. Among the highlights of this material are interviews with notable individuals including: Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, George McGovern, Alice Walker, Harry Belafonte, Philip Agee, Ted Turner, Edward Heath, Jorge Risquet, Ricardo Alarcón, Vilma Espín, and Angela Davis. These videos also contain interviews with supporters of the anti-Castro movement including counter-revolutionaries like Orlando Bosch.</p><p>Other films featured prominently in this collection address the social consequences of tensions between the United States and Cuba. These films include <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, documenting American who moved to Cuba after the revolution; <emph>The Cuban Excludables</emph>, which follows Cubans who came to the United States during the Mariel boatlift and the conditions they faced while being detained by US authorities; and  <emph render="italic">Miami-Havana</emph>, a film that explores the consequences of travel and communication restrictions between Cuba and the United States.</p><p>Not all of Bravo's films are represented in the collection. Footage from some films may be more complete than others, while footage from other films does not appear in the collection at all. In other cases video footage is duplicated in multiple series. Bravo frequently reused older footage in follow-up documentaries to provide background and context for a subsequent film. For example, footage from the 1985 film, <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, also appears in the 2007 documentary, <emph render="italic">Who Am I?: The Found Children of Argentina</emph>. Additionally, there are many interviews that exceed the duration of a single tape, and are recorded on multiple tapes. These interviews will contain pauses and breaks in the conversation to allow the videographer to change tapes.</p><p>The collection also contains footage that was not included in any feature film. These recordings may have been shot with a potential film in mind, but were never included in any completed feature. The Bravos also recorded special events or interviews with notable individuals, even though they did not intend to include them in a specific documentary. These recordings include an interview with Mikis Theodrakis, a Greek songwriter/composer and supporter of Fidel Castro, and an interview with Brazilian Communist Party leader Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990). There is also some footage which is unidentified or has not yet been associated with a specific feature film.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, two additional donations of periodicals, programs, playbills, transcripts, and related items were added to the collection. They may be found in Series XXX: Ephemera and Publications. Transcripts and partial transcripts from this donation relate to the film <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and have been added to Series VIII. Transcripts contain interviews of some individuals for which there is no film footage, including Walter Sisulu and Kalema Moutante. A small set of film reels, donated in 2014, contain personal family footage of Estela and Ernesto Bravo with friends and family members, most of which were filmed in 1958. These reels are arranged in Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p><p>Many of the dates in this collection have been estimated based on the content and release date of the film. Specific dates are listed if they appeared on the cassette annotations, while others were inferred from the film's content. The word "Bump" appears in several titles, and was used by Estela Bravo to indicate clips selected from a previous, longer, piece of footage.</p>  </scopecontent>

He explains that youth in California in the 1960s were detached and had a very pessimistic view of the future.

It begins with his wife discussing her experience of being married to an American. She discusses visits to the United States, including New York City and California, and describes the experience as a first-hand lesson in capitalism. She discusses the reason she chose to live in Cuba over a life in the United States, and explains that as an actress she would rather perform in her country. Their son also joins the conversation and discusses his education at a music school where he is studying classical guitar. Menendez then discusses freedom of expression in Cuban music, and certain restrictions that the state places on music that it distributes. He ends with a brief discussion about his hopes for the world in the post-colonial era of the late-20th century.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_7853e650ed8c7457cde4f1108fd99c99"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

The video then changes to street footage of a slum outside of Bogotá where one of the teachers discusses the effects of foreign debt on the economy, the growth of slums, her Christian belief in Liberation Theology, and efforts to improve conditions in poor communities in the city. The video then cuts to footage of a different part of the city showing children selling goods on the street.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_fc55cf5d77ee93943010f56f44f8c43a"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

He explains that many parents are unemployed and cannot provide food for their children. The priest also shows Estela Bravo a baby at the community center, and explains that it is the child of a 13-year-old girl. He explains that young girls seek work as domestic servants, but those jobs were increasingly difficult to obtain and some turned to prostitution. The end of the video features an interview with two doctors at the center. They explain that they treated problems of malnutrition and parasitic infections, which were caused by unsanitary living conditions and lack of clean drinking water.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_3bccb15c014c2d16d2969bc9ffa64883"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

The term "excludable alien" is a legal distinction that refers to immigrants or refugees who were not granted a path to citizenship because of criminal records. Approximately 2,500 of the Cubans who traveled to the United States during the Mariel Boatlift were given the "excludable" distinction and detained in American prisons.

Other interviewees include lawyers and human rights activists, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Coast Guard employees; correctional officers and other prison staff, and the detainees themselves, along with family members. Of particular interest are interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau, deputy warden and chief medical officer at the Atlanta Penitentiary where detainees were held. Interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau and Denny McLain were arranged and funded by 5th Estate Canadian Broadcasting System who used the footage for a period of time and then turned it over to the Bravos for their film.</p><p>In addition to the interviews, footage in this series contains news clips, footage from the prisons, interviews with the American families of some of the detainees, and scenes from Cuba, as the detainees arrived home and were reunited with their Cuban families. Walkiria Fernandez, an employee of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, appears in many of the clips with the detainees once they arrive in Cuba. Some of the material is duplicative and there is large amount of background footage and shots of leaving and arriving planes.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1902" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph></unittitle><unitid>cuid17733</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="590450" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">590450</unitid><unitdate normal="1990/1990" type="inclusive">1990</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_66fce439f6727c77db0b20644461cb1e" label="master dvd [31142062673119]" type="box">73</container><container id="aspace_971e7a89f51c2e16e9fd4abec004a6b8" parent="aspace_66fce439f6727c77db0b20644461cb1e" type="dvd">7, 8</container></did><phystech id="aspace_624afe0ef470d0c1b8032d7ba6eca4e8"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Content of these DVDs is born-digital.

He talks at length about the policy of US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that led to the detention of these people, and his firm's attempts to obtain trails for the detainees. He later discusses attempts to end the detention of Cuban excludable aliens through legislation, but suggests that they did not have significant support from the Cuban community in the US to pass legislation in their favor.

He shares a story about a man who he argued never should have been detained by INS, but was held in a US prison for several years because of what he describes as an arbitrary decision and a failure to individually address his case. Shoob also discusses his attempts to gain the release of several detainees and the resistance he encountered from the federal government and prison administrators.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_6cdbe11e9ea469ed6740955f013b45c6"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

They discuss Peru's limited medical resources, and the need to send patients with more complicated medical issues to hospitals and clinics in Brazil. They explain they are only able to offer palliative care to the boy, and that he will need to go to another hospital for surgery.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_23ba1782a88c6155cdb0adba338b54b9"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

The 2001 documentary <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> combines a history of the Cuban revolution with a more personal story of leader, Fidel Castro. This series contains copies of both films. It includes complete interviews and portions of interviews highlighted in the two films.

Interviewees include Alice Walker, Gabriel García Márquez, Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, Ted Turner, Nelson Mandela, Charles Rangel, George McGovern, Philip Agee, and many others who share personal anecdotes along with political and historical perspectives.</p><p>The anecdotes come not only from well-known Americans such as Harry Belafonte, Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Hank Aaron, Sydney Pollack and others, but also from many Cubans who are not well known in the United States. Among them are government officials and friends of Fidel such as Juan Almeida, Melba Hernández. Alfredo Guevara, Jorge Risquet, Antonio Núñez Jiménez, Alicia Alonso, Angela Castro, and Aleida Guevara.</p><p>This series also contains a number of interviews that are not seen in the films. They include discussions with Hortensia Bussi de Allende, the widow of Salvador Allende, and American lawyer Victor Rabinowitz.</p><p>Footage in this series also consists of clips from the Cuban State Council Archives and various news sources. Videos containing State Council footage often represent a wide date range. Some of the footage is dated 1998 which reflects the date the material was obtained, not the actual date of the events. The original dates of the footage were not recorded. Additional footage depicts Fidel Castro at a number of public events giving speeches or speaking with world leaders.

Bourne speaks about Castro's leadership in Cuba addressing concerns about human rights, and Castro's role as a leader in the post-colonial era. He ends with a brief discussion about the history of American influence in Cuba and his expectations for Cuba's fate after the United States lifts the trade embargo and after Castro leaves office.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_5bf185b14be7f0b2fc8af09ad93f157f"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

Bourne restates several of the same points in an attempt to provide fluidity for segments used in Bravo's documentary. He begins by discussing Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart and their son Fidelito. He also discusses Fidel's relationship with Celia Sanchez and the important role she played in his life. He then changes to a discussion about the immediate aftermath of the Cuban revolution, discussing why people decided to leave, the trials of former Batista government officials, and the development of contentious diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Bourne ends with several short discussions about Castro's relationship with leaders in Vietnam, Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_cdc927cb2bd831e78a30100d07f9ac44"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

The conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba, healthcare, and education.

He discusses Castro's first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart, and Castro's political activism prior to the revolution. The bulk of the interview focuses on Castellanos work representing Castro, and the other revolutionaries who were arrested after their attack on the Moncada Barracks. He discusses speaking with Díaz-Balart following the attack, and his legal representation of Raúl Castro prior to Fidel's capture. He also discusses the role of Marta Rojas who reported on the trials of the rebels captured at Moncada. At minute 22:44 Castellanos looks through photographs he saved from that period, and an image of Raúl Castro can be seen at the top of the stack.

The video begins with footage of images in Fusté's office and an interview that starts at minute 5:30. Fusté begins by speculating about end of the Castro presidency, which he predicts will occur within a year of the time in which the interview was conducted.

Lesnik begins by discussing student activism at the University of Havana and clashes with Fulgencio Batista's government. He later discusses Fidel Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart. He later describes Fidel's interest weapons and military action, and describes how the beginnings of Castro's coalition grew out of a militant faction he developed within the Partido Ortodoxo (Orthodox Party). Lesnik details Castro's personality as a young man and suggests that peers viewed him as audacious and likely to achieve prominence. He later addresses a question about racism and notes that as a Jewish man he did face some racism in Cuba, but argues that the generation that he and Castro were a part of held much less prejudice.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_d2bd623ed002c87abf409f1a24e1e9b3"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

He argues that what Cuba needs most is not internal political reform, but rather a change in the United States foreign policy toward Cuba. He argues that the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in opposition to the United States.

He addresses the criticism and admiration of Castro, and compares Castro's government with Cuba under the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. He also discusses a potential meeting between Castro and President Bill Clinton, but suggests that such a meeting would be contingent on the political situation in the United States.

Castro calls for an end to divisions on the basis of race, and encourages South Africa and its political leaders to seek to address problems in economic inequality. He discusses the history of colonialism, which led to slavery and exploitation across the globe, expresses his hope that the new South African government will serve as an example of how to break free from the legacy of that system.

He describes his decision to wear his military fatigues in Harlem, the unwelcoming reception he received from New York's political leaders, and the need to end the blockade on Cuba. He also talks about Cuba's support of independence struggles in Angola and South Africa, and the United Nations lack of recognition for their support.

assortment of video segments recorded around the year 2000. The first clip briefly shows footage of Elián González receiving a book signed by Fidel Castro, the second features Castro walking in a parade, and the next features part of a speech by US Representative Maxine Waters welcoming Castro to New York City. At minute 7:28 the video switches to footage of an interview with Arthur Strimling. In the interview, Strimling talks about watching Castro speak in Harlem in 1959. He describes the crowds who gathered to see Castro and the reception Castro received from the media and political leaders. Strimling also talks about how his views on Castro changed over the years. He explains that although he has admiration for the economic revolution in Cuba, he is troubled by the country's human rights abuses and repression of political opposition.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_169e825332a0949f7b1b74ca44af63a4"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

Also documented are the activities of many of the anti-Castro groups in Florida and in New Jersey who violently opposed travel between the United States and Cuba. Appearing in the film are US politicians including Republican Senator and former Representative from Arizona Jeff Flake; Republican former Senator and Representative from Idaho, Larry Craig; Democratic former Representative from Massachusetts, Bill Delahunt; and Democratic Massachusetts Representative, Jim McGovern. In the documentary they contend that travel between the countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans.

On July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police, soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the pontiff in Santiago.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_960dbd3ddbeb0d33073cec02dfdcd0c4"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>The 43-minute documentary <emph render="italic">Holy Father and Gloria</emph> (<emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph>) was released in 1987 and captures the turbulence of Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship. It traces the story of Carmen Gloria Quintana and her 1987 journey back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests the documentary includes interviews with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites, particularly young people, who supported the Pinochet government and felt the protests were unnecessary. Footage in this series includes shots of Quintana touring Chile, speeches by the Pope, interviews with Quintana and other Chileans, and historical footage contextualizing Chilean politics.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1907" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph></unittitle><unitid>cuid18266</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="590455" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">590455</unitid><unitdate normal="1987/1987" type="inclusive">1987</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_78971d73156bdee9f2eecaa70346510e" label="master dvd [31142062673119]" type="box">73</container><container id="aspace_3596ab0d6cb3b73ef52806fbee76c146" parent="aspace_78971d73156bdee9f2eecaa70346510e" type="dvd">10</container></did><phystech id="aspace_c0427e2672c7e13cdf0a6262ff8a8595"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Content of this DVD is born-digital.

They talk about the economic recession in the United States, lack of representation, lack of support for poor communities, and the difficulty of uniting Latin Americans in the United States because they come from so many different countries. They address other concerns, including the difficulty of organizing for more rights because they are too busy working at low wage jobs. Bravo asks their opinions about American policies on Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. They also discuss how the United States addresses problems such as drug addiction and violence.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_22e6a39fa20d67e621ee7e7d435c4bff"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

In the wake of the rumors, Cuban parents sent as many as 14,000 unaccompanied children on flights out of Cuba between 1960 and 1962. The United States government facilitated this mass exodus of Cuban children, which became popularly known as Operation Peter Pan, through a clandestine program that waived the children's visa requirements and provided several million dollars to the Miami Catholic Welfare Bureau to care for the children. Many parents expected to be reunited with their children after what they believed would be the swift fall communist government. Following the Bay of Pigs invasions in 1962, however, US-Cuba relations deteriorated, and permanently separated many parents and children. Some children were able to connect with family members in the United States, but approximately 7000 were moved into long-term orphanages or foster care.</p><p>Estela Bravo's documentary <emph render="italic">Operation Peter Pan: Flying Back to Cuba</emph> about the experience of these children was selected as Best Documentary Feature at the 2011 Havana Film Festival in New York.

At the time of the interview, which was filmed sometime around 1985, she explains that the children have lived under Pinochet for 12 years and many remember their family members disappearing or going into exile, and cannot see a future for themselves under the current government. She expresses her hope in the community and her faith that the government will eventually change. The video then focuses on news reports and photos of Carols Godoy and his murder. At minute 17:55 the videos changes to an interview with the executive secretary of the foundation Protection of Youth Damaged by State of Emergency (PIDEE), which helped children whose parents had been harmed, detained, or disappeared by the government.

The footage features a series of on-the-street interviews conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans.

Footage from this documentary includes scenes from the three rafters' arrival in Cuba and possibly a full-length copy of the film.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref675" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tres Balseros</unittitle><unitid>cuid400</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="467378" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">467378</unitid><unitdate normal="1992/1992" type="inclusive">1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_4010746055815a4dca826f58e631f60d" label="videos" type="box">31</container><container id="aspace_6c271b72ffe5ba769f128314ac273cf4" parent="aspace_4010746055815a4dca826f58e631f60d" type="cassette">ref675</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_a8a33cf2ac3092f73078e06bb913114f" label="access dvd [31142062673168]" type="Box">95</container><container id="aspace_157c58e11c0a47ad6ddd24025f96d31b" parent="aspace_a8a33cf2ac3092f73078e06bb913114f" type="dvd">ref675</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/7sqvb0xp" xlink:role="video-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Tres Balseros" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Tres Balseros: 1992</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_eb139a21d307af7332a0ab4c82d71417"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This video contains footage of three Cuban men returning to Cuba and greeting friends at family at an airport.

This film centers on an organization of women known as the " Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo" who gained worldwide recognition for their weekly demonstrations in the center of Buenos Aires and their continued search for missing children. </p><p>The film includes interviews with the found children and with people who knew their parents, as well as trial footage related to the prosecution of individuals responsible for carrying out state-sponsored violence against political dissidents. Records in this series include a completed copy of the documentary, raw footage, and a press and promotional materials related to the release of the film.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_ca5263324712f8c84db0d309137c1cd9"><head>Historical/Biographical Note</head><p>By the time <emph render="italic">Who Am I? </emph>was released in 2007, the number of found children was 88.

Examples of these recordings include clips from Brazil, from Mexico, and an interview concerning the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This series also contains several clips relating to Nelson Mandela for which the specific film cannot be determined. Other footage that cannot be associated with a specific film due to lack of contextual information is also included in this series. An example is an interview Bravo conducted with three individuals in New York. The original box annotations suggest that these individuals are Dominicans but there is no indication of the specific film.  The conversation with these individuals continues on more than one cassette. It is unclear whether this is independent material or may have been created for a specific film.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1338" level="file"><did><unittitle>"2nd Anniversary of the War of the Malvinas (No Borrar)"</unittitle><unitid>cuid18522</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="479681" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">479681</unitid><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_91eaecefad42e92728d99da94b4d70b1" label="videos" type="box">59</container><container id="aspace_3841635d93cf503f2508413a373ef48c" parent="aspace_91eaecefad42e92728d99da94b4d70b1" type="cassette">ref1338</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1065" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rosenberg Memorial Ceremony</unittitle><unitid>cuid401</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="479404" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">479404</unitid><unitdate>undated</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_69575a257097ad7953338ce274f8c4de">This video is in Spanish.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_fcccf5c4079d6bc3b6b44d7dff124b6f" label="videos [31142063166188]" type="box">63</container><container id="aspace_8cceda320173fb5a4798bf78b3059035" parent="aspace_fcccf5c4079d6bc3b6b44d7dff124b6f" type="cassette">ref1065</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_9221d128d5f89d6f7f50004e2c1f0d35" label="access dvd [31142063007119]" type="Box">96</container><container id="aspace_7292478bf584360d9c119d3484cf586a" parent="aspace_9221d128d5f89d6f7f50004e2c1f0d35" type="dvd">ref1065</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest"  xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/41ns20ft" xlink:role="video-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rosenberg Memorial Ceremony" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Rosenberg Memorial Ceremony: undated</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d54990336d9364c3a1f88400afe57ec0"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This video features two minutes of a Cuban news report on a memorial ceremony in honor of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg at the Rosenberg Memorial in Havana.

He specifically discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in supporting that work. The final 30 minutes to the tape feature assorted clips recorded from television. Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on the second half of this tape is difficult to view.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_2ef79bbdeed912ac97d52365baecf671"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

Bravo asks the Meeropols about their travel to Cuba and their impressions of the country. Much of the video on this recording is in poor condition, and in many places only the audio is available. The children of Michael and Robert Meeropol discuss their visit to Cuba and describe their understanding of how their grandparents died. At the end of the segment the family sings the Cuban folk song "Guantanamera." Beginning at minute 12:00 the video changes to various clips from Cuban television programs.

Clippings include copies of articles about Estela Bravo's films, interviews, reviews, and biographical articles about her career as a filmmaker. A large portion of this series consists of programs for conferences and documentary film festivals. Bravo's films were shown at many of these festivals but not all. The series also contains several playbills from dance and theatrical performances attended by the Bravos. Playbills do not relate to filmmaking, but rather reflect the artistic interests of the Bravos. Additionally, the series contains copies of the documentaries <emph render="italic">Porque Moncada?</emph> and <emph render="italic">Manos a la Obra</emph>. These documentaries were not created by Estela Bravo, but they address topics similar to those featured in her films.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2102" level="file"><did><unittitle>Camp

Reels contain footage of events including parties, vacations, and visits with family. They feature the Bravos during the early years of their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends. The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2116" level="file"><did><unittitle>1.

The 2017 documentary recounts the experience of Gerardo Hernández and his wife Adriana Perez who attempted to conceive a child while Hernández was serving two consecutive life sentences in the United States for espionage. Hernández, along with four other Cuban agents, was arrested in Miami in 1998 for spying on the United States, they became known as the Cuban Five. The Cuban government claimed they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists  in Miami, but the five were ultimately convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba.
