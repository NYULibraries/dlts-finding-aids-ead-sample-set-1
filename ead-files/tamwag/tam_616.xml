      <abstract id="aspace_cc23d6d697b3ecd496f3796631a3e705">Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. Estela and Ernesto Bravo moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length features and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution. This collection has been partially digitized, and only the digitized footage is currently accessible to researchers.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. The Bravos moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela Bravo's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. Bravo's documentaries have aired on television networks including PBS (US), CBC (Canada), Channel 4 (UK) Canal Plus (France), and at international film festivals and retrospectives honoring her work.</p>
      <p>Estela Bravo was born on June 8, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. The youngest of three daughters, she was raised in a family of working-class European immigrants. Estela worked for the Furriers Union while studying sociology at night at Brooklyn College. In 1953 she helped organize a group called Students for a Peaceful World. She attended the 3rd World Student Congress in Warsaw, Poland as a representative for the Students for a Peaceful World, where she met Ernesto Bravo.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Mario Bravo (1929- ) was born in Argentina on April 7, 1929. Bravo studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1951, while still a student, he was targeted by the state police for his participation in a student strike and tried on charges of organizing anti-government student activities. </p>
      <p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo married in January of 1956. They moved to Cuba in 1963 after Ernesto was offered a position as a Professor of Biochemistry at the Medical School of the University of Havana. In Cuba, Estela Bravo worked at the cultural institution Casa de las Américas where she organized programs promoting folk and protest music. She later began developing television programs and creating short documentaries based on archival footage, which documented notable figures like the Rosenbergs, Malcolm X, and Paul Robeson. Ernesto wrote many of the scripts for these short films. Estela Bravo completed her first full-length documentary in 1980, <emph render="italic">Those Who Left</emph>, which told the story of Cubans who left the island after the 1959 revolution. In addition to his teaching career, Ernesto Bravo has worked collaborator with his wife on her many documentary films, and has written a number of books, including <emph render="italic">Modern Medicine in Cuba</emph> (1995) and <emph render="italic">Development within Underdevelopment: New Trends in Cuban Medicine</emph> (1998).</p>
      <p>As of 2016, Estela and Ernesto Bravo continue to make films. In 2014, they were honored in South Africa by the Mandela Foundation, they released films about Gabriel García Márquez and Commander Juan Almeida, and they updated their 2007 film, <emph render="italic">Who am I? The Found Children of Argentina</emph>.</p>

      <head>Processing Information Note</head>
      <p>Upon receipt of this collection, Tamiment Library discovered that many of the videos had mold damage or binder hydrolysis. Several tapes have been repaired and digitized, but many have yet to receive treatment. The digitization process remains ongoing.</p>
      <p>To facilitate preservation treatment, all tapes were initially inventoried and assigned a persistent identifier, which is listed in the finding aid as the "ref" number. These numbers are not sequential and are not listed in a specific order. Individual tapes have been arranged intellectually by the full-length feature in which they appear. Tapes were originally received in boxes containing packing slips that roughly associated footage with specific films. Much of this contextual information was lost, however, due to the immediate separation of materials for preservation treatment. Information about footage content and associated feature film(s) has been reconstructed to the best of the archivist's ability through analysis of container annotations, research, and consultation with the donors. Footage has been added to the series that best represents the context of its use. Estela Bravo frequently reused footage in multiple documentaries, and consequently some footage may be duplicated in more than one series.</p>
      <p>Videos were sent for preservation treatment in multiple installments, which resulted in several non-sequential box numbers. In 2016, box numbers were updated and listed in sequential order. </p>
      <p>Titles of digitized videos have been edited or supplied by the archivist based on the content of the recording. Titles of videos that have yet to be digitized have been derived from annotations on the individual film containers and associated notes. The descriptions of video cassettes that have not yet been digitized often contain phrases in quotation marks. These phrases were copied from annotations on the cassette boxes. As digitized versions of the videos become available, descriptions are being updated.</p>
      <p>Many of the videos in this collection were undated. The majority of the dates have been estimated by the archivist based on release date of the film or the event documented in the footage.</p>
      <p>Two additional donations of ephemera, publications, transcripts, and promotional materials were donated in 2014 and 2015. Documents associated with specific films were incorporated the existing series, while publications and ephemera more generally associated with filmmaking and Estela Bravo's career were added as Series XXX: Collected Ephemera and Publications. Films reels documenting moments in Estela and Ernesto Bravo's personal lives were added as Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p>
      <p>In 2016 videos stored on a hard drive and flash drive were forensically imaged and analyzed. Duplicate copies of full-length documentaries were deaccessioned and remaining videos were incorporated into series based on the documentaries with which they correspond.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a copy of the documentary <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph> was added to the collection as Series XXXII: <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>.</p>
      <p>In 2018, 225 videos were digitized and described at the item-level.</p>
      <p>In 2020, additional recordings were described at the item-level following digitization.</p>

    <scopecontent id="aspace_abf8694dfcc2c0d917022fb307bf490f">
      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Estela and Ernesto Bravo Film and Video Collection (dates 1959-2014) contains interviews, footage, and full-length films from documentaries created by filmmaker Estela Bravo between the 1980s and early 2000s. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length documentaries and video footage, the collection also contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of important events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; historical clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage was primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution.</p>
      <p>Many of Bravo's films focus broadly on Cuba after the revolution and its relationship with the United States and other countries. Bravo's films address other issues related to Latin American politics and culture, exploring topics such as: children abducted during Argentina's "Dirty War;" Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship; the assassination of Maurice Bishop in Grenada; social and economic problems caused by Latin American debts owed to the United States; struggles to end apartheid in South Africa; and a 1984 concert featuring Cuban musicians Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes in Buenos Aires.</p>
      <p>The most extensive footage comes from <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and its follow-up <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>. There are more than 400 video recordings related to these films. Among the highlights of this material are interviews with notable individuals including: Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, George McGovern, Alice Walker, Harry Belafonte, Philip Agee, Ted Turner, Edward Heath, Jorge Risquet, Ricardo Alarcón, Vilma Espín, and Angela Davis. These videos also contain interviews with supporters of the anti-Castro movement including counter-revolutionaries like Orlando Bosch.</p>
      <p>Other films featured prominently in this collection address the social consequences of tensions between the United States and Cuba. These films include <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, documenting American who moved to Cuba after the revolution; <emph>The Cuban Excludables</emph>, which follows Cubans who came to the United States during the Mariel boatlift and the conditions they faced while being detained by US authorities; and  <emph render="italic">Miami-Havana</emph>, a film that explores the consequences of travel and communication restrictions between Cuba and the United States.</p>
      <p>Not all of Bravo's films are represented in the collection. Footage from some films may be more complete than others, while footage from other films does not appear in the collection at all. In other cases video footage is duplicated in multiple series. Bravo frequently reused older footage in follow-up documentaries to provide background and context for a subsequent film. For example, footage from the 1985 film, <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, also appears in the 2007 documentary, <emph render="italic">Who Am I?: The Found Children of Argentina</emph>. Additionally, there are many interviews that exceed the duration of a single tape, and are recorded on multiple tapes. These interviews will contain pauses and breaks in the conversation to allow the videographer to change tapes.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains footage that was not included in any feature film. These recordings may have been shot with a potential film in mind, but were never included in any completed feature. The Bravos also recorded special events or interviews with notable individuals, even though they did not intend to include them in a specific documentary. These recordings include an interview with Mikis Theodrakis, a Greek songwriter/composer and supporter of Fidel Castro, and an interview with Brazilian Communist Party leader Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990). There is also some footage which is unidentified or has not yet been associated with a specific feature film.</p>
      <p>Between 2014 and 2015, two additional donations of periodicals, programs, playbills, transcripts, and related items were added to the collection. They may be found in Series XXX: Ephemera and Publications. Transcripts and partial transcripts from this donation relate to the film <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and have been added to Series VIII. Transcripts contain interviews of some individuals for which there is no film footage, including Walter Sisulu and Kalema Moutante. A small set of film reels, donated in 2014, contain personal family footage of Estela and Ernesto Bravo with friends and family members, most of which were filmed in 1958. These reels are arranged in Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p>
      <p>Many of the dates in this collection have been estimated based on the content and release date of the film. Specific dates are listed if they appeared on the cassette annotations, while others were inferred from the film's content. The word "Bump" appears in several titles, and was used by Estela Bravo to indicate clips selected from a previous, longer, piece of footage.</p>

          <p>In the 1989 film <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, Estela Bravo tells the stories of several Americans who stayed in Cuba after the 1959 revolution. Some of the Americans featured in the documentary lived in Cuba prior and decided to remain after the new government was established, while others decided to immigrate to Cuba in the period following the revolution. This series contains footage from the 43-minute film, including interviews with women such as Elfriede Mahler; Marjorie Moore; Lorna Burdsall; Lois Kroehler, a missionary, music teacher and peace advocate who came to Cuba in 1949; Jean McEvoy and Ellen Rosensweig, who is interviewed with her husband and children and comments on the differences between her life in Cuba and her visits to see her family in California. Footage from this film contains one-on-one interviews, performances, discussions in the street or in other venues, and scenes of the various locations where the women live.</p>

            <p>Lorna Burdsall (1928-2010) moved to Cuba in 1955 with her husband, who fought with Fidel Castro in the Cuban revolution. She was a dancer who trained with Martha Graham and studied at the Julliard School. In 1953 she met a young Cuban, Manuel Pineiro, who was studying business administration at Columbia. They married in New York but he left for Cuba to join Castro's forces shortly after their wedding. She joined him in 1955 and lived in Cuba for the rest of her life. Burdsall taught at the National Dance School and was a founding member of Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna, which she eventually directed. Burdsall was with the company for nearly 20 years and created numerous works reflecting the spirit of the Cuban people. In 1977 she became the national director of dance and modern dance advisor to the Minister of Culture.</p>

She then sings a version of "No Man Is an Island," which she translated into Spanish. Kroehler then describes in Spanish the story of how she came to live in Cuba. She explains that she traveled to Cuba to learn Spanish, and after 2 years of working as a secretary was asked to stay and work as a teacher at a Jesuit school. She later began teaching classes in music and English. Kroehler also discusses the difficulty of seeing her family in the United States. She explains that it took many years until her family was able to visit her in Cuba.</p>

            <p>This interview with Lois Kroehler begins with a discussion in Spanish of her decision to move to Cuba and her experience in Cuba as a Christian. She talks at length about being a Christian in a communist country and her personal process of overcoming her own anti-communist prejudice. She discusses the United States relationship with Cuba and Latin America in general, and expresses a hope that the United States will act as a more collaborative neighbor, and do more to consider the struggles of people in the third world. The video ends with footage of signs and the countryside outside of Matanzas, Cuba.</p>

            <p>This interview with Paul (Pablo) Menendez begins with a discussion about how he first traveled to Cuba to study music when he was 14 years old. He explains that his mother, singer Barbara Dane, performed in Cuba and later arranged for him to attend a music school there in 1966. He explains that youth in California in the 1960s were detached and had a very pessimistic view of the future. He explains that  life in Cuba at that time felt very different and students were engaged in political climate of the early revolutionary government. He describes meeting his wife at the school he attended, and explains that they married after he had only lived in Cuba for a year. He was only 15 years old at the time.</p>

She discusses visits to the United States, including New York City and California, and describes the experience as a first-hand lesson in capitalism. She discusses the reason she chose to live in Cuba over a life in the United States, and explains that as an actress she would rather perform in her country. Their son also joins the conversation and discusses his education at a music school where he is studying classical guitar. Menendez then discusses freedom of expression in Cuban music, and certain restrictions that the state places on music that it distributes. He ends with a brief discussion about his hopes for the world in the post-colonial era of the late-20th century.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Olita Proctor, an American living in Cuba, and her mother and fiancé. Proctor begins by discussing how she first moved to Cuba in 1971 after traveling to the country with the progressive student group the Venceremos Brigade. She explains that she felt at home in Cuba and decided to stay after being expelled from her American high school because of her political activism. Proctor and her mother talk about racism in the United States, and Proctor explains that as a biracial woman she has felt more in welcome Cuba. She also discusses US policy toward Cuba, her hopes that the US embargo against Cuba will end, and her sense of shame about America's treatment of Cuba. At the end of the interview she expresses her hope that all of her cousins and nephews could come to Cuba to meet her Cuban family. Video quality of this recording is poor in places.</p>

            <p>This video begins with a clip from an interview with Barbara Paskalitis and her family. They briefly discuss how long they were in Cuba, and Estela directs cutaway shots of family members. The larger portion of the video contains footage from an interview with Olita Proctor and her fiancé, Christopher Fernandez. Olita talks about her activism in Berkeley, California; coming to Cuba as a high schooler with the Venceremos Brigade; her studies; and work in Cuba since then. She discusses her feeling of being at home in Cuba, US perceptions of Cuba, and her experiences with immigration and customs during her visits to the United States.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of Peruvian politician Alfonso Barrantes touring a neighborhood in Lima, Peru and speaking to community members about his "Vaso de Leche" (Glass of Milk) program. The footage shows Barrantes speaking with community members and shows children drinking milk that the local government supplies to hungry children in the city. The video then features a teacher from a local school who explains how the program works. Many of the parents and educators featured in brief interviews mention that prior to the program the children in the village had never tasted milk.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Peruvian President Alan García delivered at the Plaza de Armas sometime around the year 1987. García calls for unity among Latin American nations to fight against the crisis of foreign debt facing their countries. He criticizes wealthy nations in the north, international banks, creditors, and global financial organizations for taking advantage of Latin America. He argues that economic imperialism has led to Peru's fiscal crisis and has created extreme suffering and poverty in Peru. He contends that the only way to push back against the insurmountable debt payments is through unity among Latin American nations.</p>

            <p>This video begins with footage of a play. At minute 6:20 it changes to still images of a funeral procession. Then at minute 8:45 it changes to footage of on-the-street interviews in Argentina. Estela Bravo asks several individuals about the country's political situation and foreign debt. Several of the interviewees express frustration with the country's politics, arguing that there is high unemployment and little opportunity for the average citizen to create political change. Several individuals discuss the country's foreign debt. They question the government's ability to pay its debt and argue that average communities suffer in poverty in the meantime.</p>

This footage does not contain any audio, but at times audio from unrelated content can be heard in the background. At minute 10:24 the video changes to footage of a young boy and girl who explain that they sell flowers to support their family and pay for school. During a brief interview with Estela Bravo the boy and girl also talk about other children who take drugs, although they say they do not. Bravo then interviews several children on the street who are taking drugs and asks them why they were attracted to drugs.</p>

            <p>This video features on-the-street interviews with Argentinians in the mid-1980s discussing the effect of foreign debt on their country. Many talk about the negative consequences of the debt on the country's children, poor, and elderly. Estela Bravo asks many members of the crowd what will happen if Argentina decides not to pay the debt. Many express their concern that the poor will suffer, and others discuss the possibility of Latin American countries collectively deciding not to pay the debt. One member of the crowd suggests that without unity among Latin American nations the decision to not pay would result in economic chaos. Several men in the crowd note that they have been out of work for many years, and others speculate about what will happen in Argentina's future.</p>

            <p>This video begins with on-the-street interviews with people in Peru discussing the effect of foreign debt on their country. Some individuals suggest that the debt is the fault of the investing class, while others express their concerns about the poor and the lack of investment in schools and social services. Several members of the crowd argue about whether Peru should pay the debt or whether they should attempt to resist foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In another short interview two boys tell the story of a child who was abandoned in a park by his impoverished parents. At minute 14:00 the video changes to an interview with Peruvian economist Óscar Ugarteche. He describes the conditions that led to the debt crisis in Peru and expresses his skepticism about the country's ability to pay the debt.</p>

            <p>This video features the end of an interview with Peruvian economist Óscar Ugarteche. He discusses the economic crisis in Peru. In the interview, which was recorded in the mid-1980s, Ugarteche explains that the crisis had been building for over 10 years, and while the government focused on paying its international debt, it was not investing in the economy. He discusses the crisis of poverty, childhood hunger, and unemployment, and discusses economic changes that he thinks the country should take to emerge from the crisis. At minute 9:55 the video changes to a rally for Peruvian politician Alan García. Rally footage is incomplete and only contains short segments of his speech. The end of the video features footage of a concert.</p>

Estela Bravo then interviews several men on the street who talk about closed factories and unemployment. She tours an area where an irrigation ditch is filled with garbage, and interviews several men who make money collecting and re-selling garbage for parts. She also interviews a young boy selling candy on the street to help feed his family. The guide later explains to Bravo that the community relies on schools as a consistent source of food for children, and blames Argentina's dictatorship for the debt and austerity that has impoverished the community.</p>

The footage begins with an interview with the priest who supports the center. He discusses the problem of hunger in the community and explains that they feed 270 children. He explains that many parents are unemployed and cannot provide food for their children. The priest also shows Estela Bravo a baby at the community center, and explains that it is the child of a 13-year-old girl. He explains that young girls seek work as domestic servants, but those jobs were increasingly difficult to obtain and some turned to prostitution. The end of the video features an interview with two doctors at the center. They explain that they treated problems of malnutrition and parasitic infections, which were caused by unsanitary living conditions and lack of clean drinking water.</p>

Beginning at minute 18:30 the video shows footage of Papenfus traveling back to South Africa, which makes up the bulk of the video.

            <p>This video consists of three separate clips filmed by Estela Bravo. The first portion features a speech to a crowd of Angolan and Cuban soldiers after the 1989 ceasefire between Angola and South Africa.

The speaker praises the role of the Cuban military, the Namibian political party SWAPO, and international solidarity. After the speech Castro greets members of the crowd. At minute 16:17 the video switches to footage of equipment in an industrial yard and the construction of a truck trailer. At minute 18:49 it changes to footage of a ballet performance.</p>

          <p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo filmed <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph> after 1984 hearings, which granted the release of Cuban "excludable aliens" that had been indefinitely detained after serving prison sentences. The term "excludable alien" is a legal distinction that refers to immigrants or refugees who were not granted a path to citizenship because of criminal records. Approximately 2,500 of the Cubans who traveled to the United States during the Mariel Boatlift were given the "excludable" distinction and detained in American prisons. Estela and Ernesto Bravo interviewed detainees returning to Cuba and spoke with activists and attorneys involved in legal the battles. </p>
          <p>In 1995, <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph> won a Special Jury Prize at Cinefest, San Juan, Puerto Rico; and One World Award, Best Overseas Production on British TV, European Community BBC.</p>

          <p>This series contains full-length copies of <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph> (1994), as well as interviews with a variety of individuals including US District Judge Marvin Shoob; Wayne Smith, former head the United States Interests Section in Havana; and Dennis (Denny) McLain, a former American baseball player who spent time in prison with the Cuban detainees. Other interviewees include lawyers and human rights activists, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Coast Guard employees; correctional officers and other prison staff, and the detainees themselves, along with family members. Of particular interest are interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau, deputy warden and chief medical officer at the Atlanta Penitentiary where detainees were held. Interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau and Denny McLain were arranged and funded by 5th Estate Canadian Broadcasting System who used the footage for a period of time and then turned it over to the Bravos for their film.</p>
          <p>In addition to the interviews, footage in this series contains news clips, footage from the prisons, interviews with the American families of some of the detainees, and scenes from Cuba, as the detainees arrived home and were reunited with their Cuban families. Walkiria Fernandez, an employee of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, appears in many of the clips with the detainees once they arrive in Cuba. Some of the material is duplicative and there is large amount of background footage and shots of leaving and arriving planes.</p>

            <p>This video features brief interviews with Cuban detainees shortly after they were deported to Cuba. Several describe their experiences in the United States, discussing the prisons where they were held, experiences of racism, and difficulty of life in the US. For much of the video a woman speaks to the prisoners about how to rebuild their lives in Cuba. She explains that although they cannot return to their lives and families in the United State, they should try to adjust to living in Cuba as best as they can by reconnecting with family and finding work. Many of the prisoners can be seen crying and others are visibly distressed.</p>

            <p>This interview with Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer Duke Austin focuses on the deportation and detention of Cuban excludable immigrants. Austin begins by discussing the deportation process and addresses concerns about family members who were not notified when their relatives were deported back to Cuba. He also discusses and defends the policies that led to the detention of Cuban immigrants, and the type of people who the United States detained. Austin compares United States immigration policy for Cubans with its policy for other countries, and details the process by which a deported Cuban could petition to be readmitted to the United States.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with two women whose husbands were deported following their detention by the US Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS). They both describe learning about their husbands' deportations only after they received a box of their belongings from the prison. They also describe the effect the deportations and separation have had on their families, and their fears that their husbands would be killed if they were returned to Cuba. They both express their desire to fight for their husbands return, and speak briefly about organizing efforts between other women whose husbands were deported.</p>

            <p>This video features interviews between Linden McIntyre and two Cuban detainees who were deported to Cuba. The first, Pablo, speaks with McIntyre about how US prisons profited off of the government funds they received for holding Cuban excludable aliens. Later they discuss his family, and Pablo cries as he explains that he does not know if he will be able to see them again. The next interview features Orlando Sierra who describes the events that led to his detention by US immigration and the confusing legal process he went through before he was deported. He describes being arrested for several non-violent crimes in the 1980s, being detained by immigration in 1991, and not understanding why he was deported or flagged by immigration at that time.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with attorney Gary Leshaw. Leshaw begins by discussing how he came to represent Cuban detainees known as "excludables" through the organization Atlanta Legal Aid. He talks at length about the policy of US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that led to the detention of these people, and his firm's attempts to obtain trails for the detainees. He later discusses attempts to end the detention of Cuban excludable aliens through legislation, but suggests that they did not have significant support from the Cuban community in the US to pass legislation in their favor. He ends the tape with a short discussion about Judge Marvin Shoob's attempts to secure due process for the detainees.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Judge Marvin Shoob. Before the interview begins Shoob and Estela Bravo informally discuss Dr. Bolivar Martineau and baseball player Denny McLain. The official interview begins around minute 3:00 and features a discussion about Cubans who were detained by Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), and the difficulty of obtaining individual trials for these people. He shares a story about a man who he argued never should have been detained by INS, but was held in a US prison for several years because of what he describes as an arbitrary decision and a failure to individually address his case. Shoob also discusses his attempts to gain the release of several detainees and the resistance he encountered from the federal government and prison administrators.</p>

            <p>In this interview Judge Marvin Shoob discusses his defense of Cuban detainees' rights of habeas corpus, and the Supreme Court's decision not to hear his case. He also shares a story how his experiences during World War II influenced his approach to his career as a judge. He discusses controversial statements former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made about the Cuban detainees Shoob wanted released, and the consequences of those statements on his safety and the process of releasing individuals. Finally, he describes conditions detainees faced in American prisons, which led some detainees to suicide or self-harm.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with Judge Marvin Shoob. Shoob begins by outlining how he was assigned to the Cuban excludables cases and describing how these individuals first came to be detained. He describes reviewing the cases of the Cubans held at the Atlanta penitentiary, and talks at length about the legal situations that led to their detention and his efforts to get many of them released. Some of the content of this video is duplicated on other tapes, but this tape contains the most complete recording. At minute 49:00 the video changes to an interview with criminology professor Sheila Van Ness. She discusses the immigration trails for the Cuban detainees and the difficulty of advocating on their behalf. Van Ness describes how she interviewed many of the Cubans at the penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana and her perception of the legal process surrounding their cases.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with American diplomat Wayne Smith conducted by journalist Linden McIntyre. The interview begins with a discussion of the events that led to the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. Smith cites Cuban attempts to establish normalized immigration policies with the United States, hijackings of Cuban boats by individuals seeking to reach the US, and the occupation of the Peruvian embassy in Cuba in 1980. He talks at length about the legal status of the Mariel Cubans who were listed as excludable, and others who were paroled into the country upon arrival. He also discusses the unique situation of Mariel, and the human rights abuses that many Mariel Cubans faced after they were detained by US immigration.</p>

            <p>This interview with American diplomat Wayne Smith begins with a discussion about Cubans attempting to cross the Strait of Florida on rafts, which transitions into a discussion about Cuban "excludable aliens." This part of the interview focuses on United States immigration policy toward Cuba, which Smith describes as a double standard when compared to countries like Haiti. He also discusses the US immigration policy that led to the detention of the Cuban "excludables," and criticizes the United States for not doing more to restore normal relations with Cuba. Smith discusses the political influence of the Miami Cuban community and expresses his disappointment that Cubans and American have not had the opportunity to communicate with each other for many years.</p>

            <p>This video contains footage of an U.S. Immigration plane landing in Cuba and the transfer of the prisoners from U.S. custody to Cuban authorities. The deported prisoners are transferred from the plane onto a bus. In her conversation with the prisoners, Estela explains she is making a film for viewers in London and asks their names, how long they were in the United States, and if they are happy to be back. The prisoners share their experiences living in the United States. Many talk about being happy to return after realizing that life in the United States was harder than they anticipated, such as with the discrimination they faced there. The video also includes cutaway, close-up, and background shots.</p>

            <p>In the first clip Walkiria Fernandez speaks to the detainees. The conversations are in Spanish. The screen cuts out between 00:14:44 and 00:16:22. Following the drop-out, there are additional interviews with detainees on bus and at airport. In their interviews they discuss general abuses at the prison and Dr. Martineau. The last ten minutes of the video is damaged and contains content that is difficult to view.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with two Peruvian doctors about a young Cuban boy in their care. They explain that the boy's mother had taken him from Cuba to Peru because she believed that he would get better medical care there. The doctors, however, explain that the boy has a complicated heart condition that they cannot treat. They discuss Peru's limited medical resources, and the need to send patients with more complicated medical issues to hospitals and clinics in Brazil. They explain they are only able to offer palliative care to the boy, and that he will need to go to another hospital for surgery.</p>

          <p>The 2001 documentary <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> combines a history of the Cuban revolution with a more personal story of its leader, Fidel Castro. Because so much of the interview footage for <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> could not be included in the initial feature-length film, Estela and Ernesto Bravo made a follow-up documentary, <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>, in 2010. It includes portions of 24 interviews and expands on the stories about Fidel Castro.</p>
          <p>In 2001, <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> was selected for the Toronto Film Festival and won an award for "Distinguished Achievement for Excellence in Documentary Filmmaking" at the Urbanworld Film Festival in New York.</p>

          <p>This series contains clips, interviews, and background footage from the documentaries <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>. The 2001 documentary <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> combines a history of the Cuban revolution with a more personal story of leader, Fidel Castro. This series contains copies of both films. It includes complete interviews and portions of interviews highlighted in the two films. They feature historians, public figures, close friends, and Castro himself, and provide a glimpse into the life and personality of the Cuban leader. Interviewees include Alice Walker, Gabriel García Márquez, Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, Ted Turner, Nelson Mandela, Charles Rangel, George McGovern, Philip Agee, and many others who share personal anecdotes along with political and historical perspectives.</p>
          <p>The anecdotes come not only from well-known Americans such as Harry Belafonte, Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Hank Aaron, Sydney Pollack and others, but also from many Cubans who are not well known in the United States. Among them are government officials and friends of Fidel such as Juan Almeida, Melba Hernández. Alfredo Guevara, Jorge Risquet, Antonio Núñez Jiménez, Alicia Alonso, Angela Castro, and Aleida Guevara.</p>
          <p>This series also contains a number of interviews that are not seen in the films. They include discussions with Hortensia Bussi de Allende, the widow of Salvador Allende, and American lawyer Victor Rabinowitz.</p>
          <p>Footage in this series also consists of clips from the Cuban State Council Archives and various news sources. Videos containing State Council footage often represent a wide date range. Some of the footage is dated 1998 which reflects the date the material was obtained, not the actual date of the events. The original dates of the footage were not recorded. Additional footage depicts Fidel Castro at a number of public events giving speeches or speaking with world leaders. Other materials in this series include documents related to the promotion and distribution of <emph render="italic">Fidel</emph>, including contact lists, posters, correspondence related to distribution rights.</p>

The bulk of the interview focuses on Aaron's impression of Cuba and Fidel Castro. Aaron describes traveling to Cuba to film a documentary about Cuban baseball players, and describes the quality of education and baseball training he observed while in Cuba. He also discusses meeting Fidel Castro, and speaks specifically about Castro's athletic ability. Aaron also talks briefly about the poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, and argues that lack of trade and freedom of movement between the countries has contributed to the suffering of Cuban people and their family members in the United States.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of an interview with Ricardo Alarcón. At the beginning of the interview Alarcón discusses the political and diplomatic positions he has held within the Cuban government, including President of the National Assembly and United Nations ambassador. He discusses receiving the appointment of UN ambassador at the age of 28, and his inexperience in that position. He also describes meeting Fidel Castro for the first time when Castro's revolutionary forces entered Havana in January 1959. The bulk of the interview focuses on Alarcón's memories of Havana during the revolutionary period and the uncertainty during those years.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of an interview with Ricardo Alarcón. The recording does not start at the beginning and appears to only contain a portion of a larger interview. In this portion, Alarcón addresses Estela Bravo's questions about criticism of Cuba's lack of free press by comparing Cuba's press with privately owned newspapers in the United States. He criticizes the United States electoral system, which he contrasts with Cuban local elections. In the second half of the interview he talks about Cuba's role in Latin America, discussing both support for the Cuban government and opposition from what he describes as counter-revolutionary movements. He also talks about the significance of Fidel Castro's beard and his predictions for Cuba's future after Castro's presidency.</p>

At minute 12:42 the footage changes to an interview with Castro's translator Juanita Vera García. García discusses how she became Castro's translator, and talks about what it is like to travel with Castro and act as interpreter for some of his long public speeches.</p>

            <p>Francisco Gonzales Aruca (1941-2013) was a Cuban-American economist. He was a student at a Jesuit school in Havana at the time of the Cuban Revolution. He joined the counterrevolution and was arrested in 1961 by the Castro government. His political ideology later shifted in favor of the Cuban government, and he started the company Marazul Charters in New York with a goal of uniting fractured Cuban families.</p>

            <p>In this interview Francisco Aruca discusses people's polarized views of Fidel Castro. He discusses his own feelings about Castro, and spends some time talking about Castro's curiosity for politics. In the interview Estela Bravo asks Aruca about the slogan "No Castro, No Problem." Aruca talks about what he believes are problems with the sentiments behind the slogan, and suggests that in the present political climate, Cuba would be destabilized without Castro.</p>

            <p>This video contains portions of an interview with singer Harry Belafonte and his wife Julie Robinson. The interview begins with an anecdote about Belafonte bringing Fidel Castro a gift of cheese, and the caution with which Castro's body guards viewed the gift in light of the numerous assassination attempts that have been made against Castro. The bulk of the interview focuses on Belafonte's travels to Cuba with his family. He discusses his musical performances, and his children's enjoyment of Cuban culture. Robinson discusses bringing her parents to Cuba, and their request to be buried there after they died.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of an interview with Peter Bourne. Bourne begins with a lengthy discussion about the custody struggle over Elián González and the United States decision to return him to Cuba. He talks about the ways in which the struggle shifted Americans' perceptions of both Cuba and the exile community in Miami. The conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba, healthcare, and education. He also briefly discusses why some Cubans have left the country, the Cuban economy, and the waning support Cuba received from the Soviet Union beginning in the 1980s.</p>

            <p>This interview with Peter Bourne begins with a discussion about Cuba's interest in supporting African independence movements and perceptions of Fidel Castro in the third world. Bourne describes Castro as an elder statesman among nationalist leaders in developing nations, and discusses his image as a role model for other young leaders. He then turns to a discussion about Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II, describing the dynamic between the two men and the motivations behind the meeting. Bourne speaks about Castro's leadership in Cuba addressing concerns about human rights, and Castro's role as a leader in the post-colonial era. He ends with a brief discussion about the history of American influence in Cuba and his expectations for Cuba's fate after the United States lifts the trade embargo and after Castro leaves office.</p>

            <p>This interview with Peter Bourne primarily contains repetitions of previous topics addressed in earlier interviews with Estela Bravo. Bourne restates several of the same points in an attempt to provide fluidity for segments used in Bravo's documentary. He begins by discussing Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart and their son Fidelito. He also discusses Fidel's relationship with Celia Sanchez and the important role she played in his life. He then changes to a discussion about the immediate aftermath of the Cuban revolution, discussing why people decided to leave, the trials of former Batista government officials, and the development of contentious diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Bourne ends with several short discussions about Castro's relationship with leaders in Vietnam, Chile, Nicaragua, and Grenada.</p>

            <p>In this portion of an interview with Peter Bourne, Bourne discusses the life of Fidel Castro and his experience as Castro's biographer. Bourne begins by talking about Castro's childhood and relationship with his parents. He also discusses Castro's experience at the University of Havana, and describes corruption at Cuban universities during that era. He discusses the ways in which Castro's upbringing influenced his political ideology, specifically citing his mother's Christianity. Later in the interview Bourne describes the influential women in Castro's life including Mirta Díaz-Balart, to whom he was married for 2 years, and his long-time partner Celia Sanchez. Bourne also talks at length about Castro's character and the impression he makes on the people who meet him. This interview was recorded in London and was not conducted by Estela Bravo, but rather an unidentified man who speaks off camera.</p>

            <p>The bulk of this video features an interview with Peter Bourne. Bourne begins by speaking about the aftermath of the Cuban revolution specifically addressing the refugees and the trials of individuals connected to the Batista government. He also discusses Cuba's support of revolutions in Latin America, Castro's relationship with Maurice Bishop, the custody battle over Elián González, Cuban healthcare, Castro's views on globalization, and restrictions on freedom of speech. At minute 25:00 the video changes to footage of an auction featuring cigar boxes signed by Castro and dated March 3, 2000. At minute 27:35 footage changes to an event calling for the return of Elián González. The event features González's father Juan González Quintana, his grandmothers, and groups of school children performing Cuban songs and dances.</p>

            <p>Baudilio Castellanos Garcia (   -2002) was a lawyer and childhood friend of Fidel Castro. Castellanos attended law school with Castro, and served as one of the defense attorneys for captured insurgents arrested for the 1953 attack of the Moncada Barracks. Under the Castro government, Castellanos directed the National Institute of Tourism and served as Cuban Ambassador to France.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>In this portion of an interview with Baudillo Castellanos, Castellanos begins by speaking about his relationship with Fidel Castro prior to the revolution. He discusses Castro's first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart, and Castro's political activism prior to the revolution. The bulk of the interview focuses on Castellanos work representing Castro, and the other revolutionaries who were arrested after their attack on the Moncada Barracks. He discusses speaking with Díaz-Balart following the attack, and his legal representation of Raúl Castro prior to Fidel's capture. He also discusses the role of Marta Rojas who reported on the trials of the rebels captured at Moncada. At minute 22:44 Castellanos looks through photographs he saved from that period, and an image of Raúl Castro can be seen at the top of the stack. The video quality at the end of the recording is poor.</p>

            <p>This interview with Angela Castro begins with a discussion about Alina Fernández Revuelta, Fidel Castro's eldest daughter. Castro contends that she does not believe Revuelta is her brother's daughter, but notes that he has never denied paternity. She also discusses her sister Juana Castro, who opposed her brother's politics and moved to the United States. Later in the interview Castro speaks about the impact the Cuban Revolution had on her life and her experience of having Fidel Castro as both a brother and a president. She also addresses criticism that her children received preferential treatment because Castro was their uncle.</p>

            <p>In this interview Estela Bravo asks Marshall Frady about people's criticism of Fidel Castro for human rights abuses in Cuba. Frady argues that many of the negative reactions against Castro were formed during the Cold War, and that much of the antipathy directed at Castro formed as a result of decades of poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. The bulk of the interview focuses on popular perceptions of Fidel Castro, in which Frady describes him as a figure that inspired passionate reactions, both positive and negative. The interview is in English.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Miami radio host Tomás García Fusté. The video begins with footage of images in Fusté's office and an interview that starts at minute 5:30. Fusté begins by speculating about end of the Castro presidency, which he predicts will occur within a year of the time in which the interview was conducted. He also talks about his family members still living in Cuba, and the state of the country. He discusses Cuban exiles who have attempted to reach the US by raft or in the Mariel Boatlift, and blames Castro for the tragedies that had have happened as a result of people fleeing the country. Finally, Fusté discusses other anti-Castro Cubans in the United States including Orlando Bosch and Jorge Mas Canosa.</p>

            <p>This video begins with a brief discussion with one of Fidel Castro's university classmates about a 1980 reunion between Castro and his friends from the University of Havana. The brief footage focuses on a photograph from the event. At minute 3:35 the video changes to an interview with Manuel González Corrales. He discusses his memories of Fidel Castro at the University of Havana and their shared involvement in student activism. He describes the political environment within the university as a microcosm and training ground for the revolutionary movements that developed in Cuba, and later discusses the assassination of Student Federation leader Manolo Castro.</p>

            <p>In this interview Aleida Guevara begins with a discussion about her earliest memories of Fidel Castro. She then discusses Castro asking her to write a prolog for a book about her father, Ernesto "Che" Guevara, and his role supporting the unsuccessful revolution in Congo. She describes her enjoyment writing the prolog because it allowed her to revisit positive memories of her father. She also describes Castro's relationship with Guevara, and how Castro convinced him to return to Cuba briefly before he left to support guerilla forces in Bolivia. In the last half of the interview, she reads from the letter Castro wrote to her father convincing him to return to Cuba.</p>

Leal also describes the relationship between Castro and other prominent individuals in Cuba including Che Guevara, Celia Sanchez, Carlos Rafael Rodríguez, Conchita Fernandez, and Baudillo Castellano. Finally, he discusses Castro as a polarizing figure and talks about the opposition of many Cubans to his leadership.

            <p>This video features an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik begins by discussing student activism at the University of Havana and clashes with Fulgencio Batista's government. He later discusses Fidel Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart. He later describes Fidel's interest weapons and military action, and describes how the beginnings of Castro's coalition grew out of a militant faction he developed within the Partido Ortodoxo (Orthodox Party). Lesnik details Castro's personality as a young man and suggests that peers viewed him as audacious and likely to achieve prominence. He later addresses a question about racism and notes that as a Jewish man he did face some racism in Cuba, but argues that the generation that he and Castro were a part of held much less prejudice.</p>

He explains that he was placed in el Colegio de Belen, where he met Fidel Castro who was a student at the school. He discusses what Castro was like as a student and an athlete, and describes him as particularly diligent.

            <p>In this portion of an interview the Father Armando Llorente, Llorente shares anecdotes about Fidel Castro when he was a student at el Colegio Belen. He first shares a story about a time Castro saved him while they were trying to cross a flooding river during a school camping trip. He then talks about an incident when Castro was almost expelled because he refused reveal the location of two missing classmates to the school's rector. Llorente explains that the students had left school in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor to volunteer to fight in World War II, and Castro had promised to keep their decision secret. Finally, he looks through a yearbook from Colegio Belen, and points out a description about Castro in the yearbook.</p>

              <p>The footage begins with a 14-minute interview with Wayne Smith followed by almost four minutes of still photos, first of Fidel Castro and Smith, then followed by what appear to be photos in George McGovern's office, including photos of McGovern with Bill Clinton and with Castro. At around 18 minutes, the interview with McGovern begins.</p>
              <p>George McGovern speaks in the interview about his first speech in the Senate (1963) on the subject of US-Cuba relations and his continued support for normalization. He talks about his initial meeting with Fidel in 1975, which lasted fourteen hours over the course two days. He later discusses the powerful influence the Miami Cuban community holds in respect to American foreign policy toward Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video features a brief interview with Guatemalan human rights activist Rigoberta Menchu. Menchu discusses the way people in the third world and Latin America view Fidel Castro, and explains that many see him as a symbol of resistance against imperialism. She discusses the cold or distant reception Castro has received from politicians in the United States over the years. She explains that although political and business leaders largely oppose his presidency, opinions about Castro, even in the United States, are very diverse.</p>

            <p>This video contains an interview with Italian journalist Gianni Mina. Mina begins by discussing his background and personal history. He describes his early interest in sports journalism, and later becoming interested in politics after meeting exiled Brazilian youth living in Italy. He describes traveling to Brazil with friends and meeting Latin American intellectuals including Gabriel García Márquez. He later discusses an attempt to interview Fidel Castro at a boxing match in Monaco. He describes interviewing Castro 13 years after his initial attempt, and credits Márquez with facilitating the interview. He describes his interview with Castro in which they discussed Cuban human rights, scientific research, and the death of Che Guevara. The video contains frequent background noise, which makes some of the interview difficult to hear in places.</p>

            <p>This interview with Gianni Mina begins with a discussion about Fidel Castro's relationship with Che Guevara. Mina explains that Castro only discussed his professional relationship with Guevara, and notes that Castro expressed his disagreement with Guevara's decisions to support revolutionary movements in the third world. In particular he noted that Castro thought Guevara was impatient in his efforts to support revolutionary movements in Bolivia. The second half of the interview focuses on Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II. Mina discusses the reasons he thought the two men sought the meeting, and what each gained from the encounter. The video ends with a discussion about the role of the Catholic church in Latin America.</p>

            <p>In this interview Luis Ortega largely discusses the relationship between Cuba and the United States. He argues that what Cuba needs most is not internal political reform, but rather a change in the United States foreign policy toward Cuba. He argues that the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in opposition to the United States. He suggests that by aligning with the Soviet Union Castro hoped avoid a US funded coup similar to the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala. At the end of the interview he discusses his writing career and how his opinions toward Cuba have changed over the years.</p>

            <p>In this video Estela Bravo interviews journalist Luis Ortega about anti-Castro sentiment in Miami and the custody fight over Elián González. Ortega speaks primarily about Cuban exiles in Miami and the strong anti-Castro sentiment that exists in the city. He discusses US policy toward Cuba, criticizing aggressive US foreign policy and the trade embargo. He also discusses criticism of Cuba for political repression and its single party system, and the US government's response to human rights concerns in Cuba compared to other countries. Much of the second half of the interview focuses on the case of Elián González and the Miami Cuban community's attempt to stop his return to Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video features portions of interviews with Luis Ortega and Max Lesnik. The interview with Ortega begins where the footage from tape ref227 ends and runs until minute 16:30. In this portion of the interview he discusses the Cuban community in Miami, and the polarized opinions about Fidel Castro that the community holds. He also talks about the custody battle over Elián González and the image of Fidel Castro as a figure of anti-imperialism in Latin American. At minute 16:31 the footage changes to an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik describes his acquaintance with Castro at the University of Havana, where they were classmates. Lesnik discusses Castro's politics during that era, and the inspiration Castro drew from the political leader Eduardo Chibás and the writings of José Martí. The video quality is poor during portions of this interview.</p>

            <p>This video contains an interview with Stanley Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum talks about meeting Fidel Castro and his impression of Castro as a political leader, which he contrasts with his experience meeting Syrian leader Bashar al Assad. Filmed sometime between 1995 and 1996, Sheinbaum discusses the passage of the Helm-Burton Act by the US Congress, and speculates about impact of the upcoming 1996 elections on US policy toward Cuba. He addresses the criticism and admiration of Castro, and compares Castro's government with Cuba under the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. He also discusses a potential meeting between Castro and President Bill Clinton, but suggests that such a meeting would be contingent on the political situation in the United States. The end of the interview features still images of Sheinbaum with both Castro and Clinton.</p>

            <p>This video begins with a 30:00-minute interview with American diplomat Wayne Smith, and concludes with 30:00 minutes of footage of a parade for the Premio Internacional Benito Juárez (Benito Juárez International Prize). The interview with Smith features a discussion about his memories of Cuba prior to the Cuban Revolution, and the changes that followed. He discusses Castro's role as a leader, speaking specifically about the nationalization of US properties in Cuba and failed negotiations between the two countries. He also discusses the controversy over Elián González and criticism of human rights violations in Cuba. At minute 30:35 the video switches to footage of a parade for the Premio Internacional Benito Juárez. The bulk features on-the-street footage of the parade, while the last 5 minutes feature a performance from a children's choir.</p>

Walker discusses her memories of Castro's 1995 speech at Riverside Church in Harlem, and her experience meeting Castro in person. She addresses American media portrayals of Castro as a dictator, which she says contrasts with her perception of him. Walker also discusses Castro's knowledge of agricultural issues, and concludes that his longevity as a leader in Cuba comes from the support he has from many Cuban citizens. The end of the video features still images of Walker with Castro and during her travels in Cuba.</p>

            <p>In this footage, Fidel Castro is sitting for a portrait on his 70th birthday. This lengthy footage consists primarily of Castro speaking about a variety of subjects. It also features footage of news photographers, including Estela Bravo, to whom he appears to be speaking. He talks about his recent trip to the United States, describes an event where Yasser Arafat was asked to leave Lincoln Center, and talks about how he would have reacted if he been asked to leave. As the footage progresses, it is possible to see the progress of the portrait.</p>

            <p>This video features clips of Fidel Castro at several public events filmed around the year 2000. The majority of the clips feature rallies and town meetings in Cuba calling for the return of Elian González. Castro does not speak in any of the clips, but can be seen greeting crowds. In one section he speaks to González's father Juan Miguel González Quintana, but cannot be heard due to poor audio quality. Other clips feature Castro touring a Cuban medical school with American reporter Andrea Mitchell, and clips included at the end of the tape feature Castro greeting crowds during his travels to other countries.</p>

            <p>This video features the first portion of a speech by Fidel Castro to the South African parliament in Cape Town, South Africa. Castro begins speaking around minute 5:00. He begins by offering his support and hope for the creation of a new South Africa led by Nelson Mandela, and commends Mandela for his commitment to justice following the end of the apartheid system. Castro calls for an end to divisions on the basis of race, and encourages South Africa and its political leaders to seek to address problems in economic inequality. He discusses the history of colonialism, which led to slavery and exploitation across the globe, expresses his hope that the new South African government will serve as an example of how to break free from the legacy of that system. Audio quality of this video is poor in places.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Fidel Castro at the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Durban, South Africa. Castro begins by thanking the leaders of the South African government, and calls for reforms with the United Nations to provide greater representation of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He specifically calls for an expansion of the Security Council and an end to permanent membership. He likewise criticizes the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, both of which he argues disproportionately benefit wealthy nations, and the United States in particular. In his speech Castro also criticizes wealthy nations development and sales of weapons, lack of respect for the environment, and displacement of people in the third world.</p>

            <p>This video features a series of clips of South African president Nelson Mandela visiting Cuba. The video begins with footage of Mandela arriving in Cuba where he is greeted by Fidel Castro. The bulk features Mandela and Castro at addressing crowds across Cuba, but does not contain any complete speeches. Much of the audio captured in these clips features informal discussions between the two leaders as they  travel to different venues. Footage at the end of the video features Fidel Castro during a visit to South Africa, and ends with a segment of footage shot sometime earlier in which Mandela asks Castro to visit South Africa.</p>

            <p>This video features a small portion of a speech by Fidel Castro at a ceremony celebrating the opening of Mandela Park in Kingston, Jamaica in 1998. Castro discusses European tourism, and argues that development of Jamaican tourism does not compete with tourist economies of other Caribbean nations, but rather represents a good sign for Caribbean tourism in general. Castro is then presented with the gift of a book by Jamaican spelling bee champion Jody-Anne Maxwell.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of crowds in Montego Bay, Jamaica watching a speech by Fidel Castro. The footage focuses predominantly on individuals and their reactions to Castro's speech. Castro speaks in Spanish while his translator speaks in English, but the audio is only present in the background, while the video focuses predominantly on members of the crowd. The video starts and stops several times and as a result does not contain a complete recording of Castro's speech.</p>

            <p>This video features footage from Fidel Castro's visit to the Riverside Church in Harlem in the year 2000. The bulk of the video features footage of the crowd waiting for Castro's arrival. At minute 1:55 Estela Bravo briefly interviews Bronx Congressman Jose Serrano about his opinions of Castro and the reason the crowd at the church is eager to hear him speak. At minute 10:16 the footage changes to an interview with an American diplomat who was part of the negotiations to return Elian González to Cuba. She talks about Castro as a negotiator and her perceptions of working with him on the González case. The footage also shows Fidel Castro arriving at the church and brief welcoming statements from various speakers.</p>

            <p>This video features the final portion of Fidel Castro's speech at Riverside Church in Harlem. In this segment he thanks the American people who called for Elián González's return to Cuba, and those who protested legislation strengthening the trade embargo against Cuba. Castro then speaks about inequality and marginalization, which he acknowledges continues to exist in Cuba, and pledges his commitment to ending poor housing conditions and raising standards of living. Finally, he talks at length about what he viewed as overblown news coverage of his handshake with American President Bill Clinton, explaining that it lasted only a brief moment and the two men were simply trying to be polite.</p>

It contains an assortment of clips including: Castro meeting Latin American presidents; Gabriel García Márquez and his wife Mercedes; Castro speaking about inequality and justice; footage of Robert McNamara, Castro, and Jorge Risquet joking with each other around 00:27:00; a speech by Castro; and a celebration of Castro's birthday on plane. At 00:38:00 there is footage of a meeting in preparation for Pope's visit to Cuba. In another clip, Castro shows a set of Russian dolls and boxing puppets of himself and Bill Clinton, and around 00:56:00 there is a clip of a visit by Mohammed Ali and the Cuban boxer, Teofilo Stevenson. The sound drops out in intermittently throughout the video.</p>

            <p>This tape contains over an hour of very old clips and footage. The first 8-minute segment is from Edward R. Murrow's <emph render="italic">Person to Person</emph> television show with Fidel Castro and his son Fidelito. The footage that follows includes grainy clips of Havana after Batista fled Cuba and several shots of tourists leaving the country. These clips are mostly black and white and in some places there is no sound. Most are in Spanish, but there is a small amount of narration in English. There are also shots of enthusiastic crowds as Castro and his entourage travel through the countryside and into Havana. Some footage appears to have been shot in Harlem during Fidel's visit to the United Nations.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Fidel Castro at the Parliament of South Africa. The beginning of the video begins with representatives entering the chamber and welcoming Castro. Portions of this speech are duplicated on the video ref150. Duplicated content runs approximately from minute 12:00 to 41:00. After minute 41:00 Castro continues speaking about the potential of African youth and stresses Cuba's history of solidarity with African nations and the third world. He addresses challenges facing Africa like deforestation, desertification, and HIV/AIDS. The end of the video focuses on speculative investment and the United States economy, in which Castro criticizes the US for artificially inflating its currency. Video and audio quality of this recording is very poor.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of Fidel Castro at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem in 1995. The footage largely consists of shots of the crowd chanting " Cuba Sí, Bloqueo No," and some notable individuals can be seen in the crowd including Angela Davis and Ricardo Alarcón. The video contains several segments of speakers welcoming Castro to Harlem, but much of the footage of the speakers is cut short. The end of the recording shows Castro leaving the church and greeting the crowd.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of a speech by Fidel Castro's at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, NY. The footage begins part-way through Castro's speech. He describes his decision to wear his military fatigues in Harlem, the unwelcoming reception he received from New York's political leaders, and the need to end the blockade on Cuba. He also talks about Cuba's support of independence struggles in Angola and South Africa, and the United Nations lack of recognition for their support. After Castro's speech concludes, footage shows him leaving the church and greeting members of the crowd.</p>

            <p>This video features clips of demonstrations celebrating Fidel Castro and Cuba, and others featuring anti-Castro rallies. Rallies featured in this footage were filmed in Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and New York City. Many demonstrations coincided with a visit by Castro to these locations, and Castro appears in some of the footage. The bulk of the footage features sweeping views of the crowds, but some segments also contain brief on-the-street interviews with participants.</p>

            <p>This video features portions of a television program about the Cuban Revolution. It begins by describing the political and economic climate of Cuba prior to the revolution. The program then details events of the revolution, including the siege on the Moncada barracks, Castro's invasion from Mexico, and the revolutionaries in the Sierra Maestra. It then discusses Cuban life and government after the revolution, and describes events leading up to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The program is narrated in English, but is told from a Cuban perspective. The video does not contain a complete version of the program and starts and stops in various places.</p>

            <p>This video contains footage of Fidel Castro at the home of Ecuadorian painter Oswaldo Guayasamín. The beginning of the video features Castro speaking with Guayasamín in his studio as he works on a portrait of Castro. Subsequent footage features Castro speaking with several individuals, including Estela Bravo, about food and cooking in the kitchen of Guayasamín's home. The bulk of the footage, beginning at minute 33:00, features Fidel speaking to the group about religion, nationalism, and the market economy. He talks in particular about Catholicism and his perception of religion as a vehicle to acquire power. Castro also discusses his memories of the events of the Cuban Revolution.</p>

            <p>This video is comprised of three different segments of Cuban State Council footage. The first clip includes on-the-street footage of overcrowded buses in Havana, and people waiting in long bus lines. The clips show footage of people on bicycles, and a few cars driving by on the streets. At minute 6:10 the video switches to footage of Fidel Castro on a visit to Vietnam. This footage does not have any sound, but shows Castro meeting state leaders and shaking hands with groups of people. At minute 7:41 the tape switches to older black and white footage of a hurricane and rescue efforts to help Cuban communities affected by flooding and storm damage.</p>

            <p>This video features an assortment of video segments recorded around the year 2000. The first clip briefly shows footage of Elián González receiving a book signed by Fidel Castro, the second features Castro walking in a parade, and the next features part of a speech by US Representative Maxine Waters welcoming Castro to New York City. At minute 7:28 the video switches to footage of an interview with Arthur Strimling. In the interview, Strimling talks about watching Castro speak in Harlem in 1959. He describes the crowds who gathered to see Castro and the reception Castro received from the media and political leaders. Strimling also talks about how his views on Castro changed over the years. He explains that although he has admiration for the economic revolution in Cuba, he is troubled by the country's human rights abuses and repression of political opposition.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Fidel Castro at the 17th Congress of the Workers Central Union of Cuba or Central de Trabajadores de Cuba (CTC). The footage does not contain a complete reporting of the speech, but rather starts and stops several times to focus on the crowd. Large portions of the speech can be heard in which Castro lectures on the virtues of socialism and the power of unity among the working class. He also criticizes the United States focusing on its foreign policy, treatment of the poor, and consumer capitalism.</p>

            <p>This video features on-the-street interviews with people in Havana, Cuba. In these interviews Estela Bravo asks people what they think the future holds for Cuba. She specifically asks if they think Cuba will remain a socialist country, and whether they believe the Cuban government will retain power after Fidel Castro's leadership ends. The majority express their belief that Cuban government will remain intact. Individuals on the street also discuss their opinions about the Cuba socialism, and the reasons they have stayed in the country when many others have left.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with a mother and daughter in Key West, Florida preparing medical supplies to send in a 1993 humanitarian flotilla to Cuba. The mother and daughter discuss their reasons for supporting the flotilla and express their frustration at the people opposing it. They criticize the United States embargo against Cuba, and contend the that flotilla is a matter of human rights not politics. The video then shows footage of people loading a boat with supplies. At minute 14:10, Bravo interviews a group of people opposing the flotilla who argue that the goods will be taken by the Cuban government and sold to tourists. They express their doubt that the Cuban people will receive the goods, and instead express their fear that Castro will use the aid to control the people.</p>

          <p>Subtitled "A History of 25 Years of Travel Restrictions," the 33-minute film <emph render="italic">Free to Fly: The US-Cuba Link</emph> tells the story of efforts to maintain links between the Cuban and American people. Also documented are the activities of many of the anti-Castro groups in Florida and in New Jersey who violently opposed travel between the United States and Cuba. Appearing in the film are US politicians including Republican Senator and former Representative from Arizona Jeff Flake; Republican former Senator and Representative from Idaho, Larry Craig; Democratic former Representative from Massachusetts, Bill Delahunt; and Democratic Massachusetts Representative, Jim McGovern. In the documentary they contend that travel between the countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans. No raw footage associated with the film is available. Only a completed version of the documentary is included in this series.</p>

          <p>Estela Bravo's 1987 film <emph render="italic">Holy Father and Gloria</emph> <emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph> won many awards including Best Documentary on Current Affairs at the San Francisco International Film Festival; Gold Plaque Award at the Chicago International Film Festival; and Best Documentary at the American Film Institute Global Village Festival in New York.</p>
          <p>Carmen Gloria Quintana Arancibia (1968- ) is a Chilean woman who became a symbol of hope for democracy in Chile to many Chileans after she received an embrace and encouragement from Pope John Paul II in 1987.
On July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police, soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the pontiff in Santiago.</p>

          <p>The 43-minute documentary <emph render="italic">Holy Father and Gloria</emph> (<emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph>) was released in 1987 and captures the turbulence of Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship. It traces the story of Carmen Gloria Quintana and her 1987 journey back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests the documentary includes interviews with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites, particularly young people, who supported the Pinochet government and felt the protests were unnecessary. Footage in this series includes shots of Quintana touring Chile, speeches by the Pope, interviews with Quintana and other Chileans, and historical footage contextualizing Chilean politics.</p>

            <p>This video features youth in Chile celebrating the return of Carmen Gloria Quintana, and a brief interview with Quintana. The first several minutes feature children drawing doves and other tributes to Quintana on the street. At minute 2:58 the video changes to an interview with Quintana. She discusses her hope of meeting with the Pope, and her surprise at the warm welcome she received upon her return. She says that she hopes to continue fighting and speaking out against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, but acknowledges that protest is still very difficult. She also discusses a button featuring the Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, who died when they were both attacked by members of the Chilean military and burned. She explains that she hopes to be a representative of Rojas's memory. At minute 10:56 the footage changes to Chilean youths discussing a mural of Quintana and Rojas, painted at the location where they were attacked. A young woman and young man speak with Bravo about the significance of Quintana and Rojas to the youth movement in Chile.</p>

            <p>This video begins with footage of violent clashes between the police and protestors at O'Higgins Park in Santiago, Chile where Pope John Paul II delivered Mass to a large crowd in 1987. The footage shows protestors building makeshift barriers and throwing objects while police try to disperse them. The footage focuses primarily on the crowd, and does not show the Pope speaking, although he can be heard through a loudspeaker. The video features several on-the-street interviews: one with a man opposed to the protests, one with a local journalist, and one with a young protester. The end of this video also features an interview with exiled Chilean Socialist leader Clodomiro Almeyda. In the interview Almeyda discusses why he chose to return to Chile during the Pope's visit to the country.</p>

            <p>This video features interviews with three different groups of students in Chile. Estela Bravo asks the students, who are from middle and upper-class schools, about their opinions of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, Pope John Paul II's visit, and the attack on Carmen Gloria Quintana. Students from the various groups express different opinions on these topics, and many of the students who come from upper-class households express their support of Pinochet. They argue that the people protesting his government are mistaken and supporters of terrorism. Several students express their admiration for Pinochet, and contend that he saved the country from communism. Other students express their dislike of Pinochet, and contend that the students who support him are uninformed and are not in a position to understand the political situation of the country.</p>

            <p>Juan Pablo Letelier was the son of Orlando Letelier. Orlando Letelier was a Chilean diplomat under the government of Salvador Allende. He left Chile as a refugee of the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, and was assassinated by Pinochet's secret police in Washington D.C. in 1976.</p>

            <p>This video mostly features an interview with Juan Pablo Letelier. The first few seconds of the video contain footage of the grave of Chilean dissident Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri. It quickly changes to an interview with Letelier, which begins with a discussion about his early life and his father's assassination. He discusses leaving Chile when he was 3 years old, and returning to Chile later in life. He also talks about his involvement in leftist political movements in Chile and his participations in Chile's Socialist Youth. He discusses the significance of the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1987, and the 1989 general elections. Letelier talks at length about the political climate in Chile at the end of the 1980s discussing the country's transition to democracy and the influence of youth activism. The video quality is poor in many places.</p>

            <p>This video features an assortment of footage filmed in Chile around 1986. It begins with footage of protesters clashing with military police. It then changes to shots of newspaper headlines announcing the arrival of socialist politician Clodomiro Almeyda. At minute 9:29 the footage changes to edits of a CNN Atlanta news report on the political climate in Chile. The footage features several segments which focus on a failed national strike, the death of journalist José Carrasco, and the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. After the CNN report ends the video features additional raw footage of protests, funerals, government events, and a short speech by Pinochet denouncing communists in the country. The end of the video features footage of an impoverished community.</p>

            <p>In this interview Uruguayan politician Jaime Perez begins by discussing his travels to Cuba in the early 1970s and meeting Fidel Castro. He then talks about his 10-year imprisonment in Uruguay by the country's military dictatorship. He describes Uruguay's transition to democracy and the influence of the country's foreign debt on that process. He explains that he is optimistic about the transition to democracy, but contends that the process has just begun and that the country has a long history of repression and disappearance of political dissidents that needs to be addressed. At the end of the interview he expresses his gratitude to Castro and Cuba for supporting the Communist Party in Uruguay and its fight against the military dictatorship.</p>

          <p>This series contains a copy of the Bravo documentary <emph render="italic">Mandel and Fidel</emph>, which documents the friendship between Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro. No clips or raw footage associated with this film is included in the series. Instead, much of the footage used in this 30-minute documentary was drawn from earlier films including <emph render="italic">Namibia: The Last Colony</emph> (1990),  <emph render="italic">Mandela in Cuba</emph> (1991), and  <emph render="italic">Fidel The Untold Story</emph> (2000).</p>
          <p>The film begins with Nelson Mandela's attendance at the Namibian independence celebrations in March of 1990, a month following his release from prison. He meets with Cuban officials and expresses his gratitude for Cuba's assistance in the war in Angola and for its role in the Namibian war of independence. The next year Mandela visits Cuba. The documentary follows the relationship for several more years including Castro's attendance at Mandela's inauguration in 1994 and Fidel's visit to Robben Island to see where Mandela was imprisoned.</p>

          <p>In 1991 Nelson Mandela visited Cuba during a tour to Latin American. Then President of the African National Congress, Mandela used the tour to lobby countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela to maintain sanctions against South Africa's white minority government, and support a national unity government in Pretoria. Mandela made a three-day stop in Cuba during the tour to meet with Fidel Castro. Mandela and Castro had never met before the visit, but the two shared admiration for one another stemming from Cuba's support of Angolan and Namibian independence.</p>

Mandela's responses to questions can be heard clearly, but many of the reporters' questions and translations are difficult to hear. In this recording Estela Bravo asks Mandela a question, which can be heard clearly. Additionally, there are places where imaging is poor and scenes are difficult to view.</p>

            <p>The first ten minutes consists of scenes in a large chamber with no sound; Fidel enters and is seated.  After a few minutes of test pattern, there is sound and a picture of the Mandelas (and Jorge Risquet) at airport boarding a plane (en route to Jamaica per Estela Bravo).  There is sound and people speaking with each other but the sound of the plane engine drowns out the conversations.  There are many close-ups of the various people in Mandela's entourage.  Finally, the last few minutes return to a chamber filled with people but no sound.</p>

          <p>Released in 1983, <emph render="italic">The Marielitos</emph> (<emph render="italic">Los Marielitos</emph>) tells the story of Cubans who left the island from the port of Mariel in 1980. In the documentary, Estela Bravo interviews individuals living in Miami who were part of the Mariel boatlift two years after their arrival in the United States. She talks with them about their expectations for life in the United States and their experiences since their arrival.</p>

          <p>In the wake of an economic downturn in 1980, approximately 10,000 Cubans tried to leave Cuba and seek asylum in the Peruvian embassy. As a result, the Cuban government announced that anyone who wanted to leave the country could do so. In a joint agreement between the United States and Cuba, some 125,000 refugees left the Cuban port of Mariel bound for the United States in what came to be known as the Mariel Boatlift. Cubans who traveled to the US as part of the boatlift came to be known as Marielitos.</p>
          <p>Estela Bravo's documentary about the boatlift, <emph render="italic">The Marielitos</emph>, won the International Organization of Journalists 1st Prize at the 1984 Leipzig Film Festival and a Patria Society Award at the Moscow Film Festival.</p>

            <p>This is footage of an on-the-street interview of three Dominicans. Estela Bravo speaks with them, in Spanish, about various topics including the Reagan administration and the experience of the Spanish-speaking population in New York.  They are very critical of Reagan and his policies, which they call "anti-Latin." They talk about the economic recession in the United States, lack of representation, lack of support for poor communities, and the difficulty of uniting Latin Americans in the United States because they come from so many different countries. They address other concerns, including the difficulty of organizing for more rights because they are too busy working at low wage jobs. Bravo asks their opinions about American policies on Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. They also discuss how the United States addresses problems such as drug addiction and violence.</p>

            <p>This tape contains brief clips from <emph render="italic">Maurice</emph> film premiere. Estela Bravo makes comments, answers questions, and speaks to some individuals.  All of the dialog is in Spanish with the exception of conversation with Grenadians.  About midway through the footage, there is a shift to Alexander Haig appearing on a program called "Freeman Reports."  He is making comments following a 1984 presidential debate between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale.  He responds to one question before the end of the tape.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with Arturo Villar. He discusses his insights on what drove the balseros, people who traveled via makeshift rafts from Cuba to the United States, as well the Marielitos (refugees of the 1980 Mariel boatlift). He also discusses the creation of Radio Progeso in Miami. The second half the video contains an interview of Arturo and his wife, Jorgina, together. Jorgina talks about when they left Cuba to live in Spain, Puerto Rico, and Miami, and her subsequent visits to Cuba. At the end of the video, there are close-up shots of Arturo and conversations with his wife and the interviewers.</p>

They are retelling a story of a family divided between Cuba and the United States: one family member in the U.S. was facing challenges with living on the streets, and his family in Cuba was powerless to help. The interviewees then talk about the many people who left Cuba after the Cuban Revolution without realizing how difficult living in the United States would be.

She compares the United States with Cuba, saying that in the U.S., one needs a lot of money and has to work very hard to survive but in Cuba one doesn't pay rent, utilities, or water bills. Her sister and mother express their happiness to have the family reunited in Cuba again. The interview concludes with close-up, background, and cutaway shots of Saimi and her family. The final five minutes feature a different interview of an unidentified family discussing the hardships of maintaining connections as a family divided between the United States and Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video begins with brief segments of Cuban political leaders, including Juan Almeida meeting with dignitaries in Namibia. Beginning at minute 4:00 the footage switches to an interview with three young Namibians. The interview was recorded on the first day of Namibian independence in 1990, and the students discuss their excitement for the new government and eagerness to participate in the political process. The three students, all of whom received part of their education in Cuba, talk about their experiences studying in Cuba and the ways they hope to use their educations. They also talk briefly about continued racism in Namibia between white and black communities, and feeling removed from their country after studying abroad for several years.</p>

          <p>In 1960, rumors circulated Cuba that the new revolutionary government planned to suspend parental authority and enroll the children in military schools or send them to Russia for Communist indoctrination. In the wake of the rumors, Cuban parents sent as many as 14,000 unaccompanied children on flights out of Cuba between 1960 and 1962. The United States government facilitated this mass exodus of Cuban children, which became popularly known as Operation Peter Pan, through a clandestine program that waived the children's visa requirements and provided several million dollars to the Miami Catholic Welfare Bureau to care for the children. Many parents expected to be reunited with their children after what they believed would be the swift fall communist government. Following the Bay of Pigs invasions in 1962, however, US-Cuba relations deteriorated, and permanently separated many parents and children. Some children were able to connect with family members in the United States, but approximately 7000 were moved into long-term orphanages or foster care.</p>
          <p>Estela Bravo's documentary <emph render="italic">Operation Peter Pan: Flying Back to Cuba</emph> about the experience of these children was selected as Best Documentary Feature at the 2011 Havana Film Festival in New York. It also won First Prize at the Festival Internacional de Cine Politico, Buenos Aires; Best Documentary at the 7th Human Rights International Festival in Bolivia; and the Coral Award at the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema.</p>

            <p>This video features and interview with Father Bryan O. Walsh. Walsh begins by discussing the children currently in the care of his Catholic organization in Miami. At the time of the interview Walsh explained that he was caring for 25 children between the ages of 14 and 18. He describes the motivation of many Cuban parents who decided to send their children to the United States in the early 1960s, explaining that many feared their children would be sent to Russia for communist indoctrination. He also discusses his organization's role in clandestine efforts to send Cuban children the US, and explains that parents expected Castro would be overthrown and their children would quickly return. He later discusses children who had a difficult time adjusting to life in the US, and the Miami-based youth organization the Antonio Maceo Brigade, which was outspoken in its support of the Cuban government.</p>

          <p>In the 1970s several thousand Chilean citizens fled their country to escape the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Most of the exiles were either supporters of former president Salvador Allende or activists on the political left who feared abuse under the new government. Exiles were barred from returning for many years, but by 1984 the Chilean government agreed to grant most of the exiles permission to return home. This opening was spurred by international pressure and a domestic campaign to abolish restrictions on exiles. </p>

          <p>Estela Bravo's 1986 documentary <emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph> tells the story of Chileans exiles who returned to the country in the mid-1980s. This documentary explores the experience of youth who returned to Chile without their parents after living in exile for many years.  Several of the youths featured in the documentary discuss their difficulty adjusting to life in Chile and struggles with identity. A portion of the film focuses on Carlos Godoy Echegoyen, a twenty-three-year-old Socialist who died under torture in a police station in the port of Quintero in February 1985, shortly after returning from exile. Bravo interviews his mother and his sister. It also features scenes in a cemetery at Godoy's grave and the graves of others, including Victor Jara, and Salvador Allende. The film also tells the story of three children from one family whose parents were taken and who must fend for themselves.</p>
          <p>Videos in this series include full-length copies of the documentary with subtitles in English as well as raw footage and interviews. Footage features cemetery scenes, discussions about Carlos Godoy, Chilean religious and social welfare groups, speeches by Pinochet, and other background scenes. </p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Augusto Pinochet delivered on September 11, the anniversary of the military coup in which he seized power in Chile. In his speech, Pinochet contends that Chile must continue to fight against communism and Marxism. He discusses the history of communism and argues that Chile must stay vigilant because the goal of communism is to take over the world. He contends that his government is protecting democracy, and argues that if critics understood the threat that Chile faced they would know that his actions were correct. The second half of this video features footage of a Cuban dramatic television program filmed by Estela Bravo.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with the mother of assassinated political activist Carlos Godoy. Godoy's mother begins by discussing the youth movement in Chile and the reasons Chilean youth have expressed such strong resistance to the Pinochet government. At the time of the interview, which was filmed sometime around 1985, she explains that the children have lived under Pinochet for 12 years and many remember their family members disappearing or going into exile, and cannot see a future for themselves under the current government. She expresses her hope in the community and her faith that the government will eventually change. The video then focuses on news reports and photos of Carols Godoy and his murder. At minute 17:55 the videos changes to an interview with the executive secretary of the foundation Protection of Youth Damaged by State of Emergency (PIDEE), which helped children whose parents had been harmed, detained, or disappeared by the government. She describes the foundation, its goals, and the kind of support it provides to the children whose families were targeted for political reasons.</p>

          <p>The documentary <emph render="italic">Silvio and Pablo in Argentina</emph> (1984) shows footage from a concert held in Argentina in 1984 following the country's transition from a military dictatorship to democracy. Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes, two of Cuba's most popular composer-singer-musicians, organized the concert, which featured some of the best Argentine folk musicians at that time. The documentary shows the enthusiastic response of the Argentine people, as the musicians perform songs that had previously been prohibited in Argentina. This series contains footage of Rodriguez and Milanes in Argentina, as well as some footage of the performers at a concert in the Bronx.</p>

            <p>Lourdes Casal (1938-1981) was a Cuban poet, sociologist, and activist. She participated in anti-Batista activities in college, but later left Cuba following the revolution. She moved to New York City in 1962, where she attended the New School and received a PhD in Social Psychology. In 1969 she founded the Institute of Cuban Studies. She later returned to Cuba on a number of occasions. On a trip to Cuba in 1979, her health deteriorated and she decided to stay, dying there in 1981.</p>

            <p>This video features black-and-white footage of interviews with Cuban men who left Cuba for the United States. The footage features a series of on-the-street interviews conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Some of the men mention travelling to the US as part of the Mariel Boatlift. The term "escoria" refers to a statement made by Fidel Castro about Cuban exiles, comparing those who left to escoria (scum).</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with a man who traveled from Miami to Cuba to visit family. In this segment he discusses his impression of the country, which he contrasts with his experience of traveling to Jamaica. The video then changes to on-the-street interviews with Cubans, many of whom express their interest in leaving the country for the United States or Canada. They discuss their reasons for wanting to leave, and what they hope to find outside of Cuba. Many express dissatisfaction with the government and a desire be reunited with family members who have already left Cuba.</p>

            <p>Carlos Muniz Varela (1953-1979), along with his sister, was sent from Cuba to the United States in 1961 as a part of Operation Peter Pan. He later became an outspoken activist in favor of normalization between the United States and Cuba. On April 28, 1979, Muniz was ambushed while driving in San Juan, Puerto Rico and shot several times, most likely by individuals from a counterrevolutionary organization.</p>

          <p>The 1992 documentary <emph render="italic">The Three Rafters</emph>(<emph render="italic">Tres Balseros</emph>) tells the story of two brothers and their cousin who left Cuba illegally on a raft to Miami. They did not tell anyone about their journey, and after a few months of living in the United States, they asked to Cuba's representatives in the United States for permission to return. They were finally able to return to Cuba, and upon their arrival, they share their experiences with relatives who knew nothing of their travels to the United States. Footage from this documentary includes scenes from the three rafters' arrival in Cuba and possibly a full-length copy of the film.</p>

          <p>The 2007 documentary <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph> provides a continuation of Estela Bravo's 1985 film, <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, tracing the struggle of families of those disappeared during Argentina's "Dirty War" (1976-1983) to discover the fate of their loved ones and to recover the kidnapped children of those who were killed.

          <p>By the time <emph render="italic">Who Am I? </emph>was released in 2007, the number of found children was 88. A new version, released in 2014, provides updates to the story, including the discovery of "Grandchild 114" Guido, the grandson of Estela Carlotto. Carlotto was one of the founders and president of the Grandmothers del Plaza de Mayo and had been searching for her grandson for almost forty years. 
 
Upon its release in 2007, <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph> won the Coral Award at the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema; the Telesur Award for Best Documentary on Latin America; Best Documentary at the Toronto Film Festival; Audience Popularity Award at the Cinesul Film Festival in Rio de Janerio; and the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Award at the High Falls Film Festival in Rochester, NY.</p>

          <p>For four days, during Easter Week in 1987, the Argentine people demonstrated in the streets to prevent a military coup that threatened to overturn the elected government. The title of the documentary is taken from a popular chant of the protesters, which asked, "Who's running the show - the military or the people?"</p>

          <p>The series contains an assortment of recordings. Some of the videos contain footage that was shot independently, and not for a specific film. Examples of these recordings include clips from Brazil, from Mexico, and an interview concerning the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This series also contains several clips relating to Nelson Mandela for which the specific film cannot be determined. Other footage that cannot be associated with a specific film due to lack of contextual information is also included in this series. An example is an interview Bravo conducted with three individuals in New York. The original box annotations suggest that these individuals are Dominicans but there is no indication of the specific film.  The conversation with these individuals continues on more than one cassette. It is unclear whether this is independent material or may have been created for a specific film.</p>

            <p>This video features stitched together segments, which appear to be early edits for the documentary <emph render="italic">Mareilitos</emph> or <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph>. The footage begins with Ricardo Alarcón arriving in Cuba. He delivers a short public speech about illegal immigration to the United States and US policy toward Cuba. The remaining footage focuses on individuals attempting to travel to Florida from Cuba on rafts. Some of the footage repeats, and several portions contain voice over narration. Footage also features a brief interview segment with American diplomat Wayne Smith.</p>

            <p>This video features three interviews and a series of video clips recorded from television programs. The first interview features the widow of Cuban pacifist Luciano Nieves. She discusses her husband's assassination, and describes him as a pioneer for calling for improved relations between the US and Cuba in the 1970s. The second interview features anti-Castro political activist Felipe Rivero. Rivero discusses his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion and addresses criticism about members of his movement who have been charged with or convicted of terrorism. He specifically discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in supporting that work. The final 30 minutes to the tape feature assorted clips recorded from television. Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on the second half of this tape is difficult to view.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with three Cuban youths and their neighbor. The neighbor begins by explaining that the children were abandoned by their mother in 1980, when she left Cuba for the United States in the Mariel Boatlift. The eldest daughter explains that she was 11 years old at the time, and she and her siblings did not know how to care for themselves. They explains that they were able to survive with financial support from the government, and assistance from their neighbor who tried to help them as much as she could. At the time the interview was recorded in 1991, the family had not been able to locate their mother, and they did not know if she was still living.</p>

            <p>This video features on-the-street interviews with people in Havana discussing families divided between the United States and Cuba. A small portion of the interviewees discuss their family members who are in the United States and the difficulty of reconnecting them. They discuss the difficulty of obtaining visas to see their family in the US, and the pain of family separation. The majority of the people featured in the video, however, state that they do not have family abroad and talk generally about their pride as Cubans and their desire to stay in their country. Others discuss their opposition to the US blockade and US policy toward Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video contains portions of two interviews. The first is part of an interview with two young people in Cuba, Heidi and Ricardo, talking about their perceptions of the United States, what they envision life would be like living there, and their desire to live there. The second segment features Ana Rosa, who is the director of Lornas de Bosque, a state-run home for abandoned children, many of whom were left behind when their parents went to the United States. A young woman, Mercedes, is also interviewed with her infant sleeping beside her. She and her siblings had lived at Lornas de Bosque as children when her parents left for the United States. Estela asks her how she felt being left behind and what she would say to her parents. The video also has close-ups and cutaways of the women and the baby.</p>

            <p>Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990) was a Brazilian revolutionary. He led rebels on a three-year trek (beginning in 1924) through the interior of Brazil in an attempt to spark a rebellion in the countryside. The attempt failed, but he became a romantic figure in Brazil and went on to lead the Brazilian Communist Party. He was imprisoned after a 1935 uprising, but released after World War II, and served for a short time as a senator.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview Estela Bravo recorded with the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Michael and Robert Meeropol and their families. The footage was recorded in Springfield, MA on the 25th anniversary of the Rosenberg's death for a Cuban television program. Bravo asks the Meeropols about their travel to Cuba and their impressions of the country. Much of the video on this recording is in poor condition, and in many places only the audio is available. The children of Michael and Robert Meeropol discuss their visit to Cuba and describe their understanding of how their grandparents died. At the end of the segment the family sings the Cuban folk song "Guantanamera." Beginning at minute 12:00 the video changes to various clips from Cuban television programs. Many of these clips contain no audio. The second half of the video features a boxing match.</p>

            <p>This video features a television program on the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. It begins with a brief interview with their sons Robert and Michael Meeropol who talk about their parents and the loss they still feel many years after their deaths. The program, which initially aired in 1974, details the legal efforts to grant the Rosenbergs clemency or a stay of execution. The program then provides an update, recorded in 1978, which reviews government documents and questions the impartiality of judge Kaufman, who sentenced the Rosenbergs to death.</p>

          <p>This series consists of an assortment of ephemera, clippings, and published materials collected by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Clippings include copies of articles about Estela Bravo's films, interviews, reviews, and biographical articles about her career as a filmmaker. A large portion of this series consists of programs for conferences and documentary film festivals. Bravo's films were shown at many of these festivals but not all. The series also contains several playbills from dance and theatrical performances attended by the Bravos. Playbills do not relate to filmmaking, but rather reflect the artistic interests of the Bravos. Additionally, the series contains copies of the documentaries <emph render="italic">Porque Moncada?</emph> and <emph render="italic">Manos a la Obra</emph>. These documentaries were not created by Estela Bravo, but they address topics similar to those featured in her films.</p>

          <p>This series contains a small collection of family films recorded by Estela Bravo between the 1950s and 1960s. Reels contain footage of events including parties, vacations, and visits with family. They feature the Bravos during the early years of their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends. The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s.</p>

          <p>This series contains one electronic file of the complete documentary <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>. The 2017 documentary recounts the experience of Gerardo Hernández and his wife Adriana Perez who attempted to conceive a child while Hernández was serving two consecutive life sentences in the United States for espionage. Hernández, along with four other Cuban agents, was arrested in Miami in 1998 for spying on the United States, they became known as the Cuban Five. The Cuban government claimed they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists  in Miami, but the five were ultimately convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba. Hernández returned to Cuba two months before the birth of his daughter, Gema.</p>
